       "      <td>PORTLAND, Oregon. – Mohamed Osman Mohamud, 23, who was convicted in 2013 of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction (explosives) in connection with a plot to detonate a vehicle bomb at an annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, was sentenced today to serve 30 years in prison, followed by a lifetime term of supervised release. Mohamud, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia and former resident of Corvallis, Oregon, was arrested on Nov. 26, 2010, after he attempted to detonate what he believed to be an explosives-laden van that was parked near the tree lighting ceremony in Portland.  The arrest was the culmination of a long-term undercover operation, during which Mohamud was monitored closely for months as his bomb plot developed.  The device was in fact inert, and the public was never in danger from the device. At sentencing, United States District Court Judge Garr M. King, who presided over Mohamed’s 14-day trial, said “the intended crime was horrific,” and that the defendant, even though he was presented with options by undercover FBI employees, “never once expressed a change of heart.”  King further noted that the Christmas tree ceremony was attended by up to 10,000 people, and that the defendant “wanted everyone to leave either dead or injured.”  King said his sentence was necessary in view of the seriousness of the crime and to serve as deterrence to others who might consider similar acts.     “With today’s sentencing, Mohamed Osman Mohamud is being held accountable for his attempted use of what he believed to be a massive bomb to attack innocent civilians attending a public Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland,” said John P. Carlin, Assistant Attorney General for National Security.  “The evidence clearly indicated that Mohamud was intent on killing as many people as possible with his attack.  Fortunately, law enforcement was able to identify him as a threat, insert themselves in the place of a terrorist that Mohamud was trying to contact, and thwart Mohamud’s efforts to conduct an attack on our soil.  This case highlights how the use of undercover operations against would-be terrorists allows us to engage and disrupt those who wish to commit horrific acts of violence against the innocent public.  The many agents, analysts, and prosecutors who have worked on this case deserve great credit for their roles in protecting Portland from the threat posed by this defendant and ensuring that he was brought to justice.” “This trial provided a rare glimpse into the techniques Al Qaeda employs to radicalize home-grown extremists,” said Amanda Marshall, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.  “With the sentencing today, the court has held this defendant accountable.   I thank the dedicated professionals in the law enforcement and intelligence communities who were responsible for this successful outcome.  I look forward to our continued work with Muslim communities in Oregon who are committed to ensuring that all young people are safe from extremists who seek to radicalize others to engage in violence.”  According to the trial evidence, in February 2009, Mohamud began communicating via e-mail with Samir Khan, a now-deceased al Qaeda terrorist who published Jihad Recollections, an online magazine that advocated violent jihad, and who also published Inspire, the official magazine of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  Between February and August 2009, Mohamed exchanged approximately 150 emails with Khan.  Mohamud wrote several articles for Jihad Recollections that were published under assumed names. In August 2009, Mohamud was in email contact with Amro Al-Ali, a Saudi national who was in Yemen at the time and is today in custody in Saudi Arabia for terrorism offenses.  Al-Ali sent Mohamud detailed e-mails designed to facilitate Mohamud’s travel to Yemen to train for violent jihad.  In December 2009, while Al-Ali was in the northwest frontier province of Pakistan, Mohamud and Al-Ali discussed the possibility of Mohamud traveling to Pakistan to join Al-Ali in terrorist activities. Mohamud responded to Al-Ali in an e-mail: “yes, that would be wonderful, just tell me what I need to do.”  Al-Ali referred Mohamud to a second associate overseas and provided Mohamud with a name and email address to facilitate the process. In the following months, Mohamud made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Al-Ali’s associate.  Ultimately, an FBI undercover operative contacted Mohamud via email under the guise of being an associate of Al-Ali’s.  Mohamud and the FBI undercover operative agreed to meet in Portland in July 2010.  At the meeting, Mohamud told the FBI undercover operative he had written articles that were published in Jihad Recollections.  Mohamud also said that he wanted to become “operational.”  Asked what he meant by “operational,” Mohamud said he wanted to put an explosion together, but needed help. According to evidence presented at trial, at a meeting in August 2010, Mohamud told undercover FBI operatives he had been thinking of committing violent jihad since the age of 15.  Mohamud then told the undercover FBI operatives that he had identified a potential target for a bomb: the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland’s Pioneer Courthouse Square on Nov. 26, 2010.  The undercover FBI operatives cautioned Mohamud several times about the seriousness of this plan, noting there would be many people at the event, including children, and emphasized that Mohamud could abandon his attack plans at any time with no shame.  Mohamud indicated the deaths would be justified and that he would not mind carrying out a suicide attack on the crowd. According to evidence presented at trial, in the ensuing months Mohamud continued to express his interest in carrying out the attack and worked on logistics.  On Nov. 4, 2010, Mohamud and the undercover FBI operatives traveled to a remote location in Lincoln County, Oregon, where they detonated a bomb concealed in a backpack as a trial run for the upcoming attack.  During the drive back to Corvallis, Mohamud was asked if was capable looking at all the bodies of those who would be killed during the explosion.  In response, Mohamud noted, “I want whoever is attending that event to be, to leave either dead or injured.”  Mohamud later recorded a video of himself, with the assistance of the undercover FBI operatives, in which he read a statement that offered his rationale for his bomb attack.  On Nov. 18, 2010, undercover FBI operatives picked up Mohamud to travel to Portland to finalize the details of the attack.  On Nov. 26, 2010, just hours before the planned attack, Mohamud examined the 1,800 pound bomb in the van and remarked that it was “beautiful.”  Later that day, Mohamud was arrested after he attempted to remotely detonate the inert vehicle bomb rked near the Christmas tree lighting ceremony This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Oregon State Police, the Corvallis Police Department, the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office and the Portland Police Bureau.  The prosecution was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ethan D. Knight and Pamala Holsinger from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Oregon.  Trial Attorney Jolie F. Zimmerman, from the Counterterrorism Section of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, assisted. # # # 14-1077</td>\n",

       "      <td>$1 Million in Restitution Payments Announced to Preserve North Carolina Wetlands</td>\n",
       "      <td>WASHINGTON – North Carolina’s Waccamaw River watershed will benefit from a $1 million restitution order from a federal court, funding environmental projects to acquire and preserve wetlands in an area damaged by illegal releases of wastewater from a corporate hog farm, announced Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina Thomas G. Walker; Director Greg McLeod from the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation; and Camilla M. Herlevich, Executive Director of the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust.   Freedman Farms Inc. was sentenced in February 2012 to five years of probation and ordered to pay $1.5 million in fines, restitution and community service payments for violating the Clean Water Act when it discharged hog waste into a stream that leads to the Waccamaw River.  William B. Freedman, president of Freedman Farms, was sentenced to six months in prison to be followed by six months of home confinement.  Freedman Farms also is required to implement a comprehensive environmental compliance program and institute an annual training program.   In an order issued on April 19, 2012, the court ordered that the defendants would be responsible for restitution of $1 million in the form of five annual payments starting in January 2013, which the court will direct to the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust (NCCLT).  The NCCLT plans to use the money to acquire and conserve land along streams in the Waccamaw watershed.  The court also directed a $75,000 community service payment to the Southern Environmental Enforcement Network, an organization dedicated to environmental law enforcement training and information sharing in the region.    “The resolution of the case against Freedman Farms demonstrates the commitment of the Department of Justice to enforcing the Clean Water Act to ensure the protection of human health and the environment,” said Assistant Attorney General Moreno.  “The court-ordered restitution in this case will conserve wetlands for the benefit of the people of North Carolina.  By enforcing the nation’s environmental laws, we will continue to ensure that concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) operate without threatening our drinking water, the health of our communities and the environment.”   “This office is committed to doing our part to hold accountable those who commit crimes against our environment, which can cause serious health problems to residents and damage the environment that makes North Carolina such a beautiful place to live and visit,” said U.S. Attorney Walker.   “This case shows what we can accomplish when our SBI agents work closely with their local, state and federal partners to investigate environmental crimes and hold the polluters accountable,” said Director McLeod.  “We’ll continue our efforts to fight illegal pollution that damages our water and puts the public’s health at risk.”    “The Waccamaw is unique and wild,” said Director Herlevich of the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust. “Its watershed includes some of the most extensive cypress gum swamps in the state, and its headwaters at Lake Waccamaw contain fish that are found nowhere else on Earth.  We appreciate the trust of the court and the U. S. Attorney, and we look forward to using these funds for conservation projects in a river system that is one of our top conservation priorities.”   According to evidence presented in court, in December 2007 Freedman Farms discharged hog waste into Browder’s Branch, a tributary to the Waccamaw River that flows through the White Marsh, a large wetlands complex.  Freedman Farms, located in Columbus County, N.C., is in the business of raising hogs for market, and this particular farm had some 4,800 hogs.  The hog waste was supposed to be directed to two lagoons for treatment and disposal.  Instead, hog waste was discharged from Freedman Farms directly into Browder’s Branch.    The Clean Water Act is a federal law that makes it illegal to knowingly or negligently discharge a pollutant into a water of the United States.    The Freedman case was investigated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Criminal Investigation Division, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, with assistance from the EPA Science and Ecosystem Support Division.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney J. Gaston B. Williams of the Eastern District of North Carolina and Trial Attorney Mary Dee Carraway of the Environmental Crimes Section of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.   The North Carolina Coastal Land Trust is celebrating its 20th anniversary of saving special lands in eastern North Carolina. The organization has protected nearly 50,000 acres of lands with scenic, recreational, historic and ecological values. North Carolina Coastal Land Trust has saved streams and wetlands that provide clean water, forests that are havens for wildlife, working farms that provide local food and nature parks that everyone can enjoy.  More information about the Coastal Land Trust is available at www.coastallandtrust.org.</td>\n",

       "      <td>$1 Million Settlement Reached for Natural Resource Damages at Superfund Site in Massachusetts</td>\n",
       "      <td>BOSTON– A $1-million settlement has been reached for natural resource damages (NRD) at the Blackburn &amp; Union Privileges Superfund Site in Walpole, Mass., the Departments of Justice and Interior (DOI), and the Office of the Massachusetts Attorney General announced today.                The Blackburn &amp; Union Privileges Superfund Site includes 22 acres of contaminated land and water in Walpole. The contamination resulted from the operations of various industrial facilities dating back to the 19th century that exposed the site to asbestos, arsenic, lead and other hazardous substances.                The private parties involved in the settlement include two former owners and operators of the site, W.R. Grace &amp; Co.– Conn. and Tyco Healthcare Group LP, as well as the current owners, BIM Investment Corp. and Shaffer Realty Nominee Trust.               From about 1915 to 1936, a predecessor of W.R. Grace manufactured asbestos brake linings and clutch linings on a large portion of the property. From 1946 to about 1983, a predecessor of Tyco Healthcare operated a cotton fabric manufacturing business, which used caustic solutions, on a portion of the property.               In a 2010 settlement with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the four private parties agreed to perform a remedial action to clean up the site at an estimated cost of $13 million. The consent decree lodged today resolves both state and federal NRD liability claims; it requires the parties to pay $1,094,169.56 to the state and federal natural resource trustees, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) and DOI, for injuries to ecological resources including groundwater and wetlands, which provide habitat for waterfowl and wading birds, including black ducks and great blue herons.  The trustees will use the settlement funds for natural resource restoration projects in the area.               “This settlement demonstrates our commitment to recovering damages from the parties responsible for injury to natural resources, in partnership with state trustees,” said Bruce Gelber, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.               “The citizens of Walpole have had to live with the environmental impact of this contamination for many years,” Attorney General Martha Coakley said. “We are pleased that today’s agreement will not only require the responsible parties to reimburse taxpayer dollars, but will also provide funding to begin restoring or replacing the wetland and other natural resources.”                 The consent decree was lodged in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts.     A portion of the funds, $300,000, will be distributed to the EEA-sponsored groundwater restoration projects; $575,000 will be used for ecological restoration projects jointly sponsored by EEA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).               In addition, $125,000 will go for projects jointly sponsored by EEA and FWS that achieve both ecological and groundwater restoration; $57,491.34 will be allocated for reimbursement for the FWS’s assessment costs; and $36,678.22 will be distributed as reimbursement for the commonwealth’s assessment costs.       “This settlement provides the means for a range of projects designed to compensate the public for decades of groundwater and other ecological damage at this site.  I encourage local citizens and organizations to become engaged in the public process that will take place as we solicit, take comment on, and choose these projects in the months ahead,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Richard K. Sullivan Jr., who serves as the Commonwealth’s Natural Resources Damages trustee.       “This settlement will help restore habitat for fish and wildlife in the Neponset River watershed,” said Tom Chapman of the FWS New England Field Office. “We look forward to working with the commonwealth and local stakeholders to implement restoration.”               “More than 100 years-worth of industrial activities at this site caused major environmental contamination to the Neponset River, nearby wetlands and to groundwater below the site,” said Commissioner Kenneth Kimmell of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), which will staff the Trustee Council for the Commonwealth. “We will ensure that the community and the public will be active participants in the process to use these NRD funds to restore the injured natural resources.”                Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, EEA and DOI, acting through the FWS, are the designated state and federal natural resource Trustees for the site. The site has been listed on the EPA’s National Priorities List since 1994.        The consent decree is subject to a public comment period and court approval. A copy of the consent decree and instructions about how to submit comments is available on www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html  .               After the consent decree is approved, EEA and FWS will develop proposed restoration plans to use the settlement funds for restoration projects. The proposed restoration plans will also be made available to the public for review and comment.                Assistant Attorney General Matthew Brock of Massachusetts Attorney General Coakley's Environmental Protection Division handled this matter.  Attorney Jennifer Davis of MassDEP, Attorney Anna Blumkin of EEA and MassDEP’s NRD Coordinator Karen Pelto also worked on this settlement.</td>\n",

       "      <td>10 Las Vegas Men Indicted \\r\\nfor Falsifying Vehicle Emissions Tests</td>\n",
       "      <td>WASHINGTON—A federal grand jury in Las Vegas today returned indictments against 10 Nevada-certified emissions testers for falsifying vehicle emissions test reports, the Justice Department announced.   Each defendant faces one felony Clean Air Act count for falsifying reports between November 2007 and May 2009. The number of falsifications varied by defendant, with some defendants having falsified approximately 250 records, while others falsified more than double that figure. One defendant is alleged to have falsified over 700 reports.   The individuals indicted include:     Escudero resides in Pahrump, Nev. All other individuals are from Clark County, Nev.    The 10 defendants are alleged to have engaged in a practice known as \"clean scanning\" vehicles. The scheme involved entering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) for a vehicle that would not pass the emissions test into the computerized system, then connecting a different vehicle the testers knew would pass the test. These falsifications were allegedly performed for anywhere from $10 to $100 over and above the usual emissions testing fee.    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the Clean Air Act, requires the state of Nevada to conduct vehicle emissions testing in certain areas because the areas exceed national standards for carbon monoxide and ozone. Las Vegas is currently required to perform emissions testing.    To obtain a registration renewal, vehicle owners bring the vehicles to a licensed inspection station for testing. The emissions inspector logs into a computer to activate the system by using a unique password issued to the emissions inspector. The emissions inspector manually inputs the vehicle’s VIN to identify the tested vehicle, then connects the vehicle for model year 1996 and later to an onboard diagnostics port connected to an analyzer. The analyzer downloads data from the vehicle’s computer, analyzes the data and provides a \"pass\" or \"fail\" result. The pass or fail result and vehicle identification data are reported on the Vehicle Inspection Report. It is a crime to knowingly alter or conceal any record or other document required to be maintained by the Clean Air Act.     \"Falsifications of vehicle emissions testing, such as those alleged in the indictments unsealed today, are serious matters and we intend to use all of our enforcement tools to stop this harmful practice. These actions undermine a system that is designed to reduce air pollutants including smog and provide better air quality for the citizens of Nevada,\" said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.    \"The residents of Nevada deserve to know that the vast majority of licensed vehicle emission inspectors are not corrupt and are not circumventing emission testing procedures,\" said U.S. Attorney Bogden. \"These indictments should serve as a clear warning to offenders that the Department of Justice will prosecute you if you make fraudulent statements and reports concerning compliance with the federal Clean Air Act.\"    \"Lying about car emissions means dirtier air, which is especially of concern in areas like Las Vegas that are already experiencing air quality problems,\" said Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance at EPA. \"We will take aggressive action to ensure communities have clean air.\"    The maximum penalty for the felony violations contained in the indictments includes up to two years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.    An indictment is merely an accusation, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.    The case was investigated by the EPA, Criminal Investigation Division; and the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles Compliance Enforcement Division. The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Nevada and the Justice Department’s Environmental Crimes Section.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) announced today that two subsidiaries of Stanley Black &amp; Decker Inc.—Emhart Industries Inc. and Black &amp; Decker Inc.—have agreed to clean up dioxin contaminated sediment and soil at the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund Site in North Providence and Johnston, Rhode Island.  “We are pleased to reach a resolution through collaborative work with the responsible parties, EPA, and other stakeholders,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey H. Wood for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division . “Today’s settlement ends protracted litigation and allows for important work to get underway to restore a healthy environment for citizens living in and around the Centredale Manor Site and the Woonasquatucket River.” “This settlement demonstrates the tremendous progress we are achieving working with responsible parties, states, and our federal partners to expedite sites through the entire Superfund remediation process,” said EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler. “The Centredale Manor Site has been on the National Priorities List for 18 years; we are taking charge and ensuring the Agency makes good on its promise to clean it up for the betterment of the environment and those communities affected.” “Successfully concluding this settlement paves the way for EPA to make good on our commitment to aggressively pursue cleaning up the Centredale Manor Superfund Site,” said EPA New England Regional Administrator Alexandra Dunn. “We are excited to get to work on the cleanup at this site, and get it closer to the goal of being fully utilized by the North Providence and Johnston communities.” “We are pleased that the collective efforts of the State of Rhode Island, EPA, and DOJ in these negotiations have concluded in this major milestone toward the cleanup of the Centredale Manor Restoration Superfund site and are consistent with our long-standing efforts to make the polluter pay,” said RIDEM Director Janet Coit. “The settlement will speed up a remedy that protects public health and the river environment, and moves us closer to the day that we can reclaim recreational uses of this beautiful river resource.” The settlement, which includes cleanup work in the Woonasquatucket River (River) and bordering residential and commercial properties along the River, requires the companies to perform the remedy selected by EPA for the Site in 2012, which is estimated to cost approximately $100 million, and resolves longstanding litigation. The cleanup remedy includes excavation of contaminated sediment and floodplain soil from the Woonasquatucket River, including from adjacent residential properties. Once the cleanup remedy is completed, full access to the Woonasquatucket River should be restored for local citizens. The cleanup will be a step toward the State’s goal of a fishable and swimmable river. The work will also include upgrading caps over contaminated soil in the peninsula area of the Site that currently house two high-rise apartment buildings. The settlement also ensures that the long-term monitoring and maintenance of the site, as directed in the remedy, will be implemented to ensure that public health is protected.  Under the settlement, Emhart and Black &amp; Decker will reimburse EPA for approximately $42 million in past costs incurred at the Site. The companies will also reimburse EPA and the State of Rhode Island for future costs incurred by those agencies in overseeing the work required by the settlement. The settlement will also include payments on behalf of two federal agencies to resolve claims against those agencies. These payments, along with prior settlements related to the Site, will result in a 100 percent recovery for the United States of its past and future response costs related to the Site. Litigation related to the Site has been ongoing for nearly eight years. While the Federal District Court found Black &amp; Decker and Emhart to be liable for their hazardous waste and responsible to conduct the cleanup of the Site, it had also ruled that EPA needed to reconsider certain aspects of that cleanup. EPA appealed the decision requiring it to reconsider aspects of the cleanup. This settlement, once entered by the District Court, will resolve the litigation between the United States, Rhode Island, and Emhart and Black and Decker, allowing the cleanup of the Site to begin. The Site spans a one and a half mile stretch of the Woonasquatucket River and encompasses a nine-acre peninsula, two ponds and a significant forested wetland. From the 1940s to the early 1970s, Emhart’s predecessor operated a chemical manufacturing facility on the peninsula and used a raw material that was contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a toxic form of dioxin. The Site property was also previously used by a barrel refurbisher. Elevated levels of dioxins and other contaminants have been detected in soil, groundwater, sediment, surface water and fish.  The Site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 2000, and in December 2017, EPA included the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund Site on a list of Superfund sites targeted for immediate and intense attention. Several short-term actions were previously performed at the Site to address immediate threats to the residents and minimize potential erosion and downstream transport of contaminated soil and sediment. This settlement is the latest agreement EPA has reached since the Site was listed on the NPL. Prior agreements addressed the performance and recovery of costs for the past environmental investigations and interim cleanup actions from Emhart, the barrel reconditioning company, the current owners of the peninsula portion of the Site, and other potentially responsible parties. The Consent Decree, lodged in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island, will be posted in the Federal Register and available for public comment for a period of 30 days.

       "0  PORTLAND, Oregon. – Mohamed Osman Mohamud, 23, who was convicted in 2013 of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction (explosives) in connection with a plot to detonate a vehicle bomb at an annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, was sentenced today to serve 30 years in prison, followed by a lifetime term of supervised release. Mohamud, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia and former resident of Corvallis, Oregon, was arrested on Nov. 26, 2010, after he attempted to detonate what he believed to be an explosives-laden van that was parked near the tree lighting ceremony in Portland.  The arrest was the culmination of a long-term undercover operation, during which Mohamud was monitored closely for months as his bomb plot developed.  The device was in fact inert, and the public was never in danger from the device. At sentencing, United States District Court Judge Garr M. King, who presided over Mohamed’s 14-day trial, said “the intended crime was horrific,” and that the defendant, even though he was presented with options by undercover FBI employees, “never once expressed a change of heart.”  King further noted that the Christmas tree ceremony was attended by up to 10,000 people, and that the defendant “wanted everyone to leave either dead or injured.”  King said his sentence was necessary in view of the seriousness of the crime and to serve as deterrence to others who might consider similar acts.     “With today’s sentencing, Mohamed Osman Mohamud is being held accountable for his attempted use of what he believed to be a massive bomb to attack innocent civilians attending a public Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland,” said John P. Carlin, Assistant Attorney General for National Security.  “The evidence clearly indicated that Mohamud was intent on killing as many people as possible with his attack.  Fortunately, law enforcement was able to identify him as a threat, insert themselves in the place of a terrorist that Mohamud was trying to contact, and thwart Mohamud’s efforts to conduct an attack on our soil.  This case highlights how the use of undercover operations against would-be terrorists allows us to engage and disrupt those who wish to commit horrific acts of violence against the innocent public.  The many agents, analysts, and prosecutors who have worked on this case deserve great credit for their roles in protecting Portland from the threat posed by this defendant and ensuring that he was brought to justice.” “This trial provided a rare glimpse into the techniques Al Qaeda employs to radicalize home-grown extremists,” said Amanda Marshall, U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon.  “With the sentencing today, the court has held this defendant accountable.   I thank the dedicated professionals in the law enforcement and intelligence communities who were responsible for this successful outcome.  I look forward to our continued work with Muslim communities in Oregon who are committed to ensuring that all young people are safe from extremists who seek to radicalize others to engage in violence.”  According to the trial evidence, in February 2009, Mohamud began communicating via e-mail with Samir Khan, a now-deceased al Qaeda terrorist who published Jihad Recollections, an online magazine that advocated violent jihad, and who also published Inspire, the official magazine of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  Between February and August 2009, Mohamed exchanged approximately 150 emails with Khan.  Mohamud wrote several articles for Jihad Recollections that were published under assumed names. In August 2009, Mohamud was in email contact with Amro Al-Ali, a Saudi national who was in Yemen at the time and is today in custody in Saudi Arabia for terrorism offenses.  Al-Ali sent Mohamud detailed e-mails designed to facilitate Mohamud’s travel to Yemen to train for violent jihad.  In December 2009, while Al-Ali was in the northwest frontier province of Pakistan, Mohamud and Al-Ali discussed the possibility of Mohamud traveling to Pakistan to join Al-Ali in terrorist activities. Mohamud responded to Al-Ali in an e-mail: “yes, that would be wonderful, just tell me what I need to do.”  Al-Ali referred Mohamud to a second associate overseas and provided Mohamud with a name and email address to facilitate the process. In the following months, Mohamud made several unsuccessful attempts to contact Al-Ali’s associate.  Ultimately, an FBI undercover operative contacted Mohamud via email under the guise of being an associate of Al-Ali’s.  Mohamud and the FBI undercover operative agreed to meet in Portland in July 2010.  At the meeting, Mohamud told the FBI undercover operative he had written articles that were published in Jihad Recollections.  Mohamud also said that he wanted to become “operational.”  Asked what he meant by “operational,” Mohamud said he wanted to put an explosion together, but needed help. According to evidence presented at trial, at a meeting in August 2010, Mohamud told undercover FBI operatives he had been thinking of committing violent jihad since the age of 15.  Mohamud then told the undercover FBI operatives that he had identified a potential target for a bomb: the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland’s Pioneer Courthouse Square on Nov. 26, 2010.  The undercover FBI operatives cautioned Mohamud several times about the seriousness of this plan, noting there would be many people at the event, including children, and emphasized that Mohamud could abandon his attack plans at any time with no shame.  Mohamud indicated the deaths would be justified and that he would not mind carrying out a suicide attack on the crowd. According to evidence presented at trial, in the ensuing months Mohamud continued to express his interest in carrying out the attack and worked on logistics.  On Nov. 4, 2010, Mohamud and the undercover FBI operatives traveled to a remote location in Lincoln County, Oregon, where they detonated a bomb concealed in a backpack as a trial run for the upcoming attack.  During the drive back to Corvallis, Mohamud was asked if was capable looking at all the bodies of those who would be killed during the explosion.  In response, Mohamud noted, “I want whoever is attending that event to be, to leave either dead or injured.”  Mohamud later recorded a video of himself, with the assistance of the undercover FBI operatives, in which he read a statement that offered his rationale for his bomb attack.  On Nov. 18, 2010, undercover FBI operatives picked up Mohamud to travel to Portland to finalize the details of the attack.  On Nov. 26, 2010, just hours before the planned attack, Mohamud examined the 1,800 pound bomb in the van and remarked that it was “beautiful.”  Later that day, Mohamud was arrested after he attempted to remotely detonate the inert vehicle bomb rked near the Christmas tree lighting ceremony This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Oregon State Police, the Corvallis Police Department, the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office and the Portland Police Bureau.  The prosecution was handled by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Ethan D. Knight and Pamala Holsinger from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Oregon.  Trial Attorney Jolie F. Zimmerman, from the Counterterrorism Section of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, assisted. # # # 14-1077   \n",

Moreno, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division; U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina Thomas G. Walker; Director Greg McLeod from the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation; and Camilla M. Herlevich, Executive Director of the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust.   Freedman Farms Inc. was sentenced in February 2012 to five years of probation and ordered to pay $1.5 million in fines, restitution and community service payments for violating the Clean Water Act when it discharged hog waste into a stream that leads to the Waccamaw River.  William B. Freedman, president of Freedman Farms, was sentenced to six months in prison to be followed by six months of home confinement.  Freedman Farms also is required to implement a comprehensive environmental compliance program and institute an annual training program.   In an order issued on April 19, 2012, the court ordered that the defendants would be responsible for restitution of $1 million in the form of five annual payments starting in January 2013, which the court will direct to the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust (NCCLT).  The NCCLT plans to use the money to acquire and conserve land along streams in the Waccamaw watershed.  The court also directed a $75,000 community service payment to the Southern Environmental Enforcement Network, an organization dedicated to environmental law enforcement training and information sharing in the region.    “The resolution of the case against Freedman Farms demonstrates the commitment of the Department of Justice to enforcing the Clean Water Act to ensure the protection of human health and the environment,” said Assistant Attorney General Moreno.  “The court-ordered restitution in this case will conserve wetlands for the benefit of the people of North Carolina.  By enforcing the nation’s environmental laws, we will continue to ensure that concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) operate without threatening our drinking water, the health of our communities and the environment.”   “This office is committed to doing our part to hold accountable those who commit crimes against our environment, which can cause serious health problems to residents and damage the environment that makes North Carolina such a beautiful place to live and visit,” said U.S. Attorney Walker.   “This case shows what we can accomplish when our SBI agents work closely with their local, state and federal partners to investigate environmental crimes and hold the polluters accountable,” said Director McLeod.  “We’ll continue our efforts to fight illegal pollution that damages our water and puts the public’s health at risk.”    “The Waccamaw is unique and wild,” said Director Herlevich of the North Carolina Coastal Land Trust. “Its watershed includes some of the most extensive cypress gum swamps in the state, and its headwaters at Lake Waccamaw contain fish that are found nowhere else on Earth.  We appreciate the trust of the court and the U. S. Attorney, and we look forward to using these funds for conservation projects in a river system that is one of our top conservation priorities.”   According to evidence presented in court, in December 2007 Freedman Farms discharged hog waste into Browder’s Branch, a tributary to the Waccamaw River that flows through the White Marsh, a large wetlands complex.  Freedman Farms, located in Columbus County, N.C., is in the business of raising hogs for market, and this particular farm had some 4,800 hogs.  The hog waste was supposed to be directed to two lagoons for treatment and disposal.  Instead, hog waste was discharged from Freedman Farms directly into Browder’s Branch.    The Clean Water Act is a federal law that makes it illegal to knowingly or negligently discharge a pollutant into a water of the United States.    The Freedman case was investigated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Criminal Investigation Division, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, with assistance from the EPA Science and Ecosystem Support Division.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney J. Gaston B. Williams of the Eastern District of North Carolina and Trial Attorney Mary Dee Carraway of the Environmental Crimes Section of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.   The North Carolina Coastal Land Trust is celebrating its 20th anniversary of saving special lands in eastern North Carolina.

The contamination resulted from the operations of various industrial facilities dating back to the 19th century that exposed the site to asbestos, arsenic, lead and other hazardous substances.                The private parties involved in the settlement include two former owners and operators of the site, W.R. Grace & Co.– Conn. and Tyco Healthcare Group LP, as well as the current owners, BIM Investment Corp. and Shaffer Realty Nominee Trust.               From about 1915 to 1936, a predecessor of W.R. Grace manufactured asbestos brake linings and clutch linings on a large portion of the property. From 1946 to about 1983, a predecessor of Tyco Healthcare operated a cotton fabric manufacturing business, which used caustic solutions, on a portion of the property.               In a 2010 settlement with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the four private parties agreed to perform a remedial action to clean up the site at an estimated cost of $13 million. The consent decree lodged today resolves both state and federal NRD liability claims; it requires the parties to pay $1,094,169.56 to the state and federal natural resource trustees, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA) and DOI, for injuries to ecological resources including groundwater and wetlands, which provide habitat for waterfowl and wading birds, including black ducks and great blue herons.  The trustees will use the settlement funds for natural resource restoration projects in the area.               “This settlement demonstrates our commitment to recovering damages from the parties responsible for injury to natural resources, in partnership with state trustees,” said Bruce Gelber, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.               “The citizens of Walpole have had to live with the environmental impact of this contamination for many years,” Attorney General Martha Coakley said. “We are pleased that today’s agreement will not only require the responsible parties to reimburse taxpayer dollars, but will also provide funding to begin restoring or replacing the wetland and other natural resources.”                 The consent decree was lodged in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts.     A portion of the funds, $300,000, will be distributed to the EEA-sponsored groundwater restoration projects; $575,000 will be used for ecological restoration projects jointly sponsored by EEA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).               In addition, $125,000 will go for projects jointly sponsored by EEA and FWS that achieve both ecological and groundwater restoration; $57,491.34 will be allocated for reimbursement for the FWS’s assessment costs; and $36,678.22 will be distributed as reimbursement for the commonwealth’s assessment costs.       “This settlement provides the means for a range of projects designed to compensate the public for decades of groundwater and other ecological damage at this site.  I encourage local citizens and organizations to become engaged in the public process that will take place as we solicit, take comment on, and choose these projects in the months ahead,” said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Richard K. Sullivan Jr., who serves as the Commonwealth’s Natural Resources Damages trustee.       “This settlement will help restore habitat for fish and wildlife in the Neponset River watershed,” said Tom Chapman of the FWS New England Field Office. “We look forward to working with the commonwealth and local stakeholders to implement restoration.”               “More than 100 years-worth of industrial activities at this site caused major environmental contamination to the Neponset River, nearby wetlands and to groundwater below the site,” said Commissioner Kenneth Kimmell of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), which will staff the Trustee Council for the Commonwealth. “We will ensure that the community and the public will be active participants in the process to use these NRD funds to restore the injured natural resources.”                Under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, EEA and DOI, acting through the FWS, are the designated state and federal natural resource Trustees for the site. The site has been listed on the EPA’s National Priorities List since 1994.        The consent decree is subject to a public comment period and court approval. A copy of the consent decree and instructions about how to submit comments is available on www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html  .               After the consent decree is approved, EEA and FWS will develop proposed restoration plans to use the settlement funds for restoration projects. The proposed restoration plans will also be made available to the public for review and comment.                Assistant Attorney General Matthew Brock of Massachusetts Attorney General Coakley's Environmental Protection Division handled this matter.  Attorney Jennifer Davis of MassDEP, Attorney Anna Blumkin of EEA and MassDEP’s NRD Coordinator Karen Pelto also worked on this settlement.   \n",

Each defendant faces one felony Clean Air Act count for falsifying reports between November 2007 and May 2009. The number of falsifications varied by defendant, with some defendants having falsified approximately 250 records, while others falsified more than double that figure. One defendant is alleged to have falsified over 700 reports.   The individuals indicted include:     Escudero resides in Pahrump, Nev. All other individuals are from Clark County, Nev.    The 10 defendants are alleged to have engaged in a practice known as \"clean scanning\" vehicles. The scheme involved entering the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) for a vehicle that would not pass the emissions test into the computerized system, then connecting a different vehicle the testers knew would pass the test. These falsifications were allegedly performed for anywhere from $10 to $100 over and above the usual emissions testing fee.    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the Clean Air Act, requires the state of Nevada to conduct vehicle emissions testing in certain areas because the areas exceed national standards for carbon monoxide and ozone. Las Vegas is currently required to perform emissions testing.    To obtain a registration renewal, vehicle owners bring the vehicles to a licensed inspection station for testing. The emissions inspector logs into a computer to activate the system by using a unique password issued to the emissions inspector. The emissions inspector manually inputs the vehicle’s VIN to identify the tested vehicle, then connects the vehicle for model year 1996 and later to an onboard diagnostics port connected to an analyzer. The analyzer downloads data from the vehicle’s computer, analyzes the data and provides a \"pass\" or \"fail\" result. The pass or fail result and vehicle identification data are reported on the Vehicle Inspection Report. It is a crime to knowingly alter or conceal any record or other document required to be maintained by the Clean Air Act.     \"Falsifications of vehicle emissions testing, such as those alleged in the indictments unsealed today, are serious matters and we intend to use all of our enforcement tools to stop this harmful practice. These actions undermine a system that is designed to reduce air pollutants including smog and provide better air quality for the citizens of Nevada,\" said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division.    \"The residents of Nevada deserve to know that the vast majority of licensed vehicle emission inspectors are not corrupt and are not circumventing emission testing procedures,\" said U.S. Attorney Bogden. \"These indictments should serve as a clear warning to offenders that the Department of Justice will prosecute you if you make fraudulent statements and reports concerning compliance with the federal Clean Air Act.\"    \"Lying about car emissions means dirtier air, which is especially of concern in areas like Las Vegas that are already experiencing air quality problems,\" said Cynthia Giles, Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance at EPA. \"We will take aggressive action to ensure communities have clean air.\"    The maximum penalty for the felony violations contained in the indictments includes up to two years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.    An indictment is merely an accusation, and a defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.

Wood for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division . “Today’s settlement ends protracted litigation and allows for important work to get underway to restore a healthy environment for citizens living in and around the Centredale Manor Site and the Woonasquatucket River.” “This settlement demonstrates the tremendous progress we are achieving working with responsible parties, states, and our federal partners to expedite sites through the entire Superfund remediation process,” said EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler. “The Centredale Manor Site has been on the National Priorities List for 18 years; we are taking charge and ensuring the Agency makes good on its promise to clean it up for the betterment of the environment and those communities affected.” “Successfully concluding this settlement paves the way for EPA to make good on our commitment to aggressively pursue cleaning up the Centredale Manor Superfund Site,” said EPA New England Regional Administrator Alexandra Dunn. “We are excited to get to work on the cleanup at this site, and get it closer to the goal of being fully utilized by the North Providence and Johnston communities.” “We are pleased that the collective efforts of the State of Rhode Island, EPA, and DOJ in these negotiations have concluded in this major milestone toward the cleanup of the Centredale Manor Restoration Superfund site and are consistent with our long-standing efforts to make the polluter pay,” said RIDEM Director Janet Coit. “The settlement will speed up a remedy that protects public health and the river environment, and moves us closer to the day that we can reclaim recreational uses of this beautiful river resource.” The settlement, which includes cleanup work in the Woonasquatucket River (River) and bordering residential and commercial properties along the River, requires the companies to perform the remedy selected by EPA for the Site in 2012, which is estimated to cost approximately $100 million, and resolves longstanding litigation. The cleanup remedy includes excavation of contaminated sediment and floodplain soil from the Woonasquatucket River, including from adjacent residential properties. Once the cleanup remedy is completed, full access to the Woonasquatucket River should be restored for local citizens. The cleanup will be a step toward the State’s goal of a fishable and swimmable river. The work will also include upgrading caps over contaminated soil in the peninsula area of the Site that currently house two high-rise apartment buildings. The settlement also ensures that the long-term monitoring and maintenance of the site, as directed in the remedy, will be implemented to ensure that public health is protected.  Under the settlement, Emhart and Black & Decker will reimburse EPA for approximately $42 million in past costs incurred at the Site. The companies will also reimburse EPA and the State of Rhode Island for future costs incurred by those agencies in overseeing the work required by the settlement. The settlement will also include payments on behalf of two federal agencies to resolve claims against those agencies. These payments, along with prior settlements related to the Site, will result in a 100 percent recovery for the United States of its past and future response costs related to the Site. Litigation related to the Site has been ongoing for nearly eight years. While the Federal District Court found Black & Decker and Emhart to be liable for their hazardous waste and responsible to conduct the cleanup of the Site, it had also ruled that EPA needed to reconsider certain aspects of that cleanup. EPA appealed the decision requiring it to reconsider aspects of the cleanup. This settlement, once entered by the District Court, will resolve the litigation between the United States, Rhode Island, and Emhart and Black and Decker, allowing the cleanup of the Site to begin. The Site spans a one and a half mile stretch of the Woonasquatucket River and encompasses a nine-acre peninsula, two ponds and a significant forested wetland. From the 1940s to the early 1970s, Emhart’s predecessor operated a chemical manufacturing facility on the peninsula and used a raw material that was contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a toxic form of dioxin. The Site property was also previously used by a barrel refurbisher. Elevated levels of dioxins and other contaminants have been detected in soil, groundwater, sediment, surface water and fish.  The Site was added to the National Priorities List (NPL) in 2000, and in December 2017, EPA included the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund Site on a list of Superfund sites targeted for immediate and intense attention. Several short-term actions were previously performed at the Site to address immediate threats to the residents and minimize potential erosion and downstream transport of contaminated soil and sediment. This settlement is the latest agreement EPA has reached since the Site was listed on the NPL. Prior agreements addressed the performance and recovery of costs for the past environmental investigations and interim cleanup actions from Emhart, the barrel reconditioning company, the current owners of the peninsula portion of the Site, and other potentially responsible parties. The Consent Decree, lodged in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island, will be posted in the Federal Register and available for public comment for a period of 30 days. The Consent Decree can be viewed on the Justice Department website: www.justice.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html.  EPA information on the Centredale Manor Superfund Site: www.epa.gov/superfund/centredale.   \n",

       "      <td>The Department of Justice announced that this morning John W. Ng, 58, of Albuquerque, N.M., made his initial appearance in federal court on a criminal complaint charging him with a hate crime offense.  This charge is related to anti-Semitic threats Ng made against a Jewish woman who owns and operates the Nosh Jewish Delicatessen and Bakery in Albuquerque. Ng was arrested by the FBI on March 7, 2014, based on a criminal complaint alleging that he interfered with the victim’s federally protected rights by threatening her and interfering with her business because of her religion.  According to the criminal complaint, between Jan. 22, 2014, and Feb. 8, 2014, Ng allegedly posted threatening anti-Semitic notes on and in the vicinity of the victim’s business. A criminal complaint merely establishes probable cause, and Ng is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.  If convicted on the offense charged in the criminal complaint, Ng faces a maximum statutory penalty of one year in prison. This matter was investigated by the Albuquerque Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark T. Baker of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Mexico and Trial Attorney AeJean Cha of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

       "      <td>John Hall, 27, an Aryan Brotherhood member and inmate at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Seagoville, Texas, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor after pleading guilty to violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act stemming from his assault of a fellow inmate, whom he believed to be gay, the Department of Justice announced. Hall assaulted his fellow inmate with a dangerous weapon, causing bodily injury to the victim on Dec. 20, 2011. Hall was sentenced to serve 71 months in prison to be served consecutively with the sentence he is currently serving. The assault occurred on Dec. 20, 2011, inside the FCI Seagoville when Hall targeted and attacked the victim, a fellow inmate, because he believed the victim was gay or involved in a sexual relationship with another male inmate. Hall repeatedly punched, kicked and stomped on the victim’s face with his shod feet, a dangerous weapon, while yelling a homophobic slur. The victim lost consciousness during the assault and suffered multiple lacerations to his face. The victim also sustained a fractured eye socket, lost a tooth, fractured other teeth and was treated at a hospital for the injuries he sustained during Hall’s unprovoked attack. Hall pleaded guilty to violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act on Nov. 8, 2012. “Brutality and violence based on sexual orientation has no place in a civilized society,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department is committed to using all the tools in our law enforcement arsenal, including the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, to prosecute acts motivated by hate.” “This prosecution sends a clear message that this office, in partnership with attorneys in the department’s Civil Rights Division, will prioritize and aggressively prosecute hate crimes and others civil rights violations in North Texas,” said U.S. Attorney Sarah R. Saldaña of the Northern District of Texas. This case was investigated by the FBI Dallas Division. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Errin Martin and Trial Attorney Adriana Vieco of the Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

Ng, 58, of Albuquerque, N.M., made his initial appearance in federal court on a criminal complaint charging him with a hate crime offense.  This charge is related to anti-Semitic threats Ng made against a Jewish woman who owns and operates the Nosh Jewish Delicatessen and Bakery in Albuquerque. Ng was arrested by the FBI on March 7, 2014, based on a criminal complaint alleging that he interfered with the victim’s federally protected rights by threatening her and interfering with her business because of her religion.  According to the criminal complaint, between Jan. 22, 2014, and Feb. 8, 2014, Ng allegedly posted threatening anti-Semitic notes on and in the vicinity of the victim’s business. A criminal complaint merely establishes probable cause, and Ng is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.  If convicted on the offense charged in the criminal complaint, Ng faces a maximum statutory penalty of one year in prison. This matter was investigated by the Albuquerque Division of the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark T. Baker of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Mexico and Trial Attorney AeJean Cha of the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.   \n",
       "572  John Hall, 27, an Aryan Brotherhood member and inmate at the Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Seagoville, Texas, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor after pleading guilty to violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act stemming from his assault of a fellow inmate, whom he believed to be gay, the Department of Justice announced. Hall assaulted his fellow inmate with a dangerous weapon, causing bodily injury to the victim on Dec. 20, 2011. Hall was sentenced to serve 71 months in prison to be served consecutively with the sentence he is currently serving. The assault occurred on Dec. 20, 2011, inside the FCI Seagoville when Hall targeted and attacked the victim, a fellow inmate, because he believed the victim was gay or involved in a sexual relationship with another male inmate. Hall repeatedly punched, kicked and stomped on the victim’s face with his shod feet, a dangerous weapon, while yelling a homophobic slur. The victim lost consciousness during the assault and suffered multiple lacerations to his face. The victim also sustained a fractured eye socket, lost a tooth, fractured other teeth and was treated at a hospital for the injuries he sustained during Hall’s unprovoked attack. Hall pleaded guilty to violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act on Nov. 8, 2012. “Brutality and violence based on sexual orientation has no place in a civilized society,” said Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. “The Justice Department is committed to using all the tools in our law enforcement arsenal, including the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, to prosecute acts motivated by hate.” “This prosecution sends a clear message that this office, in partnership with attorneys in the department’s Civil Rights Division, will prioritize and aggressively prosecute hate crimes and others civil rights violations in North Texas,” said U.S. Attorney Sarah R. Saldaña of the Northern District of Texas. This case was investigated by the FBI Dallas Division. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Errin Martin and Trial Attorney Adriana Vieco of the Civil Rights Division.   \n",

       "      <td>A former supervisory correctional officer at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, Louisiana, pleaded guilty yesterday in connection with the beating of a handcuffed and shackled inmate, in addition to conspiring to cover up their misconduct by falsifying official records and lying to internal investigators about what happened.     James Savoy, 39, of Marksville, Louisiana, admitted during his plea hearing that he witnessed other officers using excessive force against the inmate and failed to intervene; that he conspired with other officers to cover up the beating by engaging in a variety of obstructive acts; and that he personally falsified official prison records to cover up the attack.   Scotty Kennedy, 48, of Beebe, Arkansas, and John Sanders, 30, of Marksville, Louisiana previously pleaded guilty in November 2016, and September 2017, for their roles in the beating and cover up.   “Every citizen has the right to due process and protection from unreasonable force, and correctional officers who violate these basic Constitutional rights must be held accountable for their egregious actions” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division.  “The Justice Department will continue to vigorously prosecute correctional officers who violate the public’s trust by committing crimes and to covering up violations of federal criminal law.”   “Yesterday is another example of our office’s unwavering commitment to pursuing those who violate the federal criminal civil rights laws,” said Acting United States Attorney for the Middle District of Louisiana Corey Amundson. “We will continue to work closely with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and the FBI to ensure that no one is above the law.”     This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Baton Rouge Resident Agency and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Frederick A. Menner, Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana and Trial Attorney Christopher J. Perras of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.</td>\n",

Fierce further admitted that before the incident he had used racial epithets against guests, including young children, who visited the victim’s home. \"Living in one’s home and associating with friends of one’s choosing, without violent interference because of race, is a core right of all persons in this country,\" said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \"The defendant used violence against an innocent victim because of his racial prejudice. This is illegal, and despicable, and we will prosecute such crimes whenever and wherever they occur.\" The FBI, the Charleston Police Department and the Charleston Fire Department investigated this case. The case was prosecuted by James Walsh with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and Lisa G. Johnson, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia.</td>\n",

Cronan of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Matthew D. Krueger of the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Jeffrey H. Ernisse, 61, is currently incarcerated for state offenses related to child exploitation at the Red Granite Correctional Institution in Wisconsin.  A grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin indicted Ernisse on two counts of producing child pornography, two counts of producing child pornography outside of the United States, one count of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Philippines and one count of possessing child pornography. According to the indictment, on or about March 10, 2015 and then again, on or about April 7, 2015, Ernisse used a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing child pornography.  Between approximately June 17, 2014, and approximately April 11, 2015, Ernisse engaged in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Republic of the Philippines.  And on or about Dec. 18, 2015, Ernisse possessed child pornography. The charges contained in the indictment are merely allegations.  The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.                  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is investigating this case with the cooperation of the Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Police Department.  Trial Attorney William M. Grady of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Megan J. Paulson and Penelope L. Coblentz of the Eastern District of Wisconsin are prosecuting the case. This investigation is a part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to better locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Wyoming Military Department Found Liable for Subjecting Employee to Sexual Harassment</td>\n",
       "      <td>The Justice Department today announced that on March 21, 2018, a federal district court in Casper, Wyoming, found that the Wyoming Military Department (WMD) discriminated against former employee Amanda Dykes by subjecting her to sexual harassment and constructively discharging her.  The verdict was returned after a July 2017 bench trial during which the Justice Department produced evidence that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, and religion.   The evidence produced at trial showed that Dykes was subjected to sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, former employee Don Smith, when both worked at WMD’s Wyoming Youth Challenge Program.  Smith subjected Dykes to persistent, unwelcomed conduct including poems, songs, and emails professing his affection and love for her as well as constant visits to her office.  These intensified to such a degree that Dykes asked her subordinates to help her avoid being left alone with her supervisor.      Dykes reported the supervisor’s conduct to her employer’s human resources department as well as to his direct supervisor, but received no assistance in remedying the harassment.  The court found that harassing behavior persisted for over 18 months despite Dykes’ numerous complaints, that no reasonable employee could be expected to remain in her job under these circumstances, and that Dykes had no choice but to resign her position in September 2011 to avoid the continued harassment.    The district court ordered WMD to pay $221,030.62 to Dykes for the salary and benefits she lost as a result of her constructive discharge.    This judgment represents the first successful sexual harassment trial verdict obtained in a Title VII case since the launch of the Civil Rights Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative (SHWI), which focuses on workplace sexual harassment in the public sector.   As part of the Initiative, the Justice Department will continue to bring sex discrimination claims against state and local government employers with a renewed emphasis on sexual harassment charges.  The Department will also work to develop effective remedial measures that can be used to hold public sector employers accountable where Title VII violations have been found, including identifying changes to existing employer practices and policies that will result in safe work environments.  More information about the Civil Rights’ Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative can be found here.   “The Justice Department vigorously enforces Title VII to ensure that people can work free from sexual harassment and retaliation,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore  of the Civil Rights Division.  “The verdict sends the clear message that this Justice Department will continue to effectively combat sex-based discrimination whenever it occurs in a public sector workplace.”   Dykes originally filed her sexual harassment charge against the WMD with the Denver Field Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which investigated and determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that discrimination had occurred and referred the matters to the Department of Justice.             More information about Title VII and other federal employment laws is available at the division’s Employment Litigation Section website.  The continued enforcement of Title VII is a priority of the Civil Rights Division.  Additional information about the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is available on the division website.    EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its website.    The United States was represented in this case by Robert Galbreath, Torie Atkinson, Brian McEntire, and Patty Stasco.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Anthony Merrell Tyler, 34, of Yuba City, California, was sentenced today by U.S. District Court Judge John A. Mendez to serve 46 months in prison for violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  The crime involved a racially motivated attack by Tyler and two co-defendants, Billy Hammett, 30, and Perry Jackson, 29, on a white man and an African-American woman in Marysville, California, in 2011.  In addition to his term of incarceration, Tyler was ordered to serve three years of supervised release upon his release from prison and to pay $175 in restitution. According to documents filed with the court, around 10:45 p.m. on April 18, 2011, a white man and an African-American woman parked their car at a convenience store in Marysville.  Shortly afterward, the three defendants attacked the man and woman because of their race.  Jackson punched him twice in the head through the open passenger window.  At the same time, Hammett opened the driver-side door and kicked the woman in the chest.  Seconds later, Tyler smashed the car’s windshield with a crowbar, sending shattered glass into the passenger compartment.  As the attack continued, the woman managed to take refuge inside the convenience store and the man struggled to get away.  All three assailants then descended upon the male victim and began attacking him in the parking lot.  He sustained abrasions on his right forearm and knees, while the woman suffered bruising to her chest.  None of the defendants knew their victims.  In today’s hearing, and during Hammett and Jackson’s proceedings, Judge Mendez considered the defendants’ backgrounds and criminal histories.  Tyler has the words “white pride” tattooed down the backs of his arms and a swastika on his left upper arm.  He has previously acknowledged being a member of the Yuba County Peckerwoods, a local white supremacist group.  Hammett, who has a tattoo of the words “white power” across his abdomen, was previously convicted for the unprovoked assault on a 72-year-old African-American man and was sentenced on March 25, 2014, to 87 months in prison.  Jackson, who has the words “white power” tattooed in block letters down his shins, was sentenced on April 29, 2014, to 70 months in prison.  Tyler entered his guilty plea on March 11, 2014. “These three defendants targeted the victims because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta for the Civil Rights Division.  “This type of attack causes harm not only to the immediate victims, but tears at the fabric of our communities and society itself.  The department will continue to vigorously prosecute such acts of racial violence.” “Racially motivated violence not only threatens the harmony of our diverse communities, it undermines the principle of equality under law, which is a foundation of our society,” said U.S. Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner for the Eastern District of California.  “For these reasons, prosecuting hate crimes will continue to be one of our highest priorities.” This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Yuba County Sheriff’s Office and the Yuba County District Attorney’s Office.  The case was prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Wagner and Trial Attorney Chiraag Bains of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

Menner, Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana and Trial Attorney Christopher J. Perras of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.   \n",

Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Joyce White Vance of the Northern District of Alabama. Gregory Jerome Lee, 53, formerly of Cullman County, Alabama, was indicted on four counts of production of child pornography, one count of conspiracy to advertise child pornography and one count of conspiracy to distribute and receive child pornography. According to the indictment, from September 1996 through December 2004, Lee used, persuaded, coerced and enticed minors to engage in sexually explicit conduct in order to produce images of that conduct.  Between September 1996 and August 2007, Lee conspired with other individuals to distribute and receive child pornography through a variety of means, including the Internet. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) is investigating the case.  Trial Attorney Amy E. Larson of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Hutzell of the Northern District of Alabama are prosecuting the case.  The charges and allegations contained in an indictment are merely accusations.  The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.  Members of the public who may have information related to this matter should call the USPIS Birmingham Office at (205) 326-2909.

Fierce set fire to the victim’s home because African-American and biracial individuals visited the victim in her home. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Fierce faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is scheduled for July 30, 2009. According to documents filed in court, on or about July 16, 2007, Fierce admitted that he set fire to a home located on Noyes Avenue in Charleston because the tenant occupying the home, a white woman, associated with persons of another race and color. Fierce set fire to the outside wall of the victim’s bedroom at night as she slept. Fierce further admitted that before the incident he had used racial epithets against guests, including young children, who visited the victim’s home. \"Living in one’s home and associating with friends of one’s choosing, without violent interference because of race, is a core right of all persons in this country,\" said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \"The defendant used violence against an innocent victim because of his racial prejudice. This is illegal, and despicable, and we will prosecute such crimes whenever and wherever they occur.\" The FBI, the Charleston Police Department and the Charleston Fire Department investigated this case. The case was prosecuted by James Walsh with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and Lisa G. Johnson, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia.   \n",

Ernisse, 61, is currently incarcerated for state offenses related to child exploitation at the Red Granite Correctional Institution in Wisconsin.  A grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin indicted Ernisse on two counts of producing child pornography, two counts of producing child pornography outside of the United States, one count of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Philippines and one count of possessing child pornography. According to the indictment, on or about March 10, 2015 and then again, on or about April 7, 2015, Ernisse used a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing child pornography.  Between approximately June 17, 2014, and approximately April 11, 2015, Ernisse engaged in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Republic of the Philippines.  And on or about Dec. 18, 2015, Ernisse possessed child pornography. The charges contained in the indictment are merely allegations.  The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.                  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is investigating this case with the cooperation of the Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Police Department.  Trial Attorney William M. Grady of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Megan J. Paulson and Penelope L. Coblentz of the Eastern District of Wisconsin are prosecuting the case. This investigation is a part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to better locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.   \n",

       "715  The Justice Department today announced that on March 21, 2018, a federal district court in Casper, Wyoming, found that the Wyoming Military Department (WMD) discriminated against former employee Amanda Dykes by subjecting her to sexual harassment and constructively discharging her.  The verdict was returned after a July 2017 bench trial during which the Justice Department produced evidence that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, and religion.   The evidence produced at trial showed that Dykes was subjected to sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, former employee Don Smith, when both worked at WMD’s Wyoming Youth Challenge Program.  Smith subjected Dykes to persistent, unwelcomed conduct including poems, songs, and emails professing his affection and love for her as well as constant visits to her office.  These intensified to such a degree that Dykes asked her subordinates to help her avoid being left alone with her supervisor.      Dykes reported the supervisor’s conduct to her employer’s human resources department as well as to his direct supervisor, but received no assistance in remedying the harassment.  The court found that harassing behavior persisted for over 18 months despite Dykes’ numerous complaints, that no reasonable employee could be expected to remain in her job under these circumstances, and that Dykes had no choice but to resign her position in September 2011 to avoid the continued harassment.    The district court ordered WMD to pay $221,030.62 to Dykes for the salary and benefits she lost as a result of her constructive discharge.    This judgment represents the first successful sexual harassment trial verdict obtained in a Title VII case since the launch of the Civil Rights Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative (SHWI), which focuses on workplace sexual harassment in the public sector.   As part of the Initiative, the Justice Department will continue to bring sex discrimination claims against state and local government employers with a renewed emphasis on sexual harassment charges.  The Department will also work to develop effective remedial measures that can be used to hold public sector employers accountable where Title VII violations have been found, including identifying changes to existing employer practices and policies that will result in safe work environments.  More information about the Civil Rights’ Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative can be found here.   “The Justice Department vigorously enforces Title VII to ensure that people can work free from sexual harassment and retaliation,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore  of the Civil Rights Division.  “The verdict sends the clear message that this Justice Department will continue to effectively combat sex-based discrimination whenever it occurs in a public sector workplace.”   Dykes originally filed her sexual harassment charge against the WMD with the Denver Field Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which investigated and determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that discrimination had occurred and referred the matters to the Department of Justice.             More information about Title VII and other federal employment laws is available at the division’s Employment Litigation Section website.  The continued enforcement of Title VII is a priority of the Civil Rights Division.  Additional information about the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is available on the division website.    EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its website.    The United States was represented in this case by Robert Galbreath, Torie Atkinson, Brian McEntire, and Patty Stasco.   \n",

Mendez to serve 46 months in prison for violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  The crime involved a racially motivated attack by Tyler and two co-defendants, Billy Hammett, 30, and Perry Jackson, 29, on a white man and an African-American woman in Marysville, California, in 2011.  In addition to his term of incarceration, Tyler was ordered to serve three years of supervised release upon his release from prison and to pay $175 in restitution. According to documents filed with the court, around 10:45 p.m. on April 18, 2011, a white man and an African-American woman parked their car at a convenience store in Marysville.  Shortly afterward, the three defendants attacked the man and woman because of their race.  Jackson punched him twice in the head through the open passenger window.  At the same time, Hammett opened the driver-side door and kicked the woman in the chest.  Seconds later, Tyler smashed the car’s windshield with a crowbar, sending shattered glass into the passenger compartment.  As the attack continued, the woman managed to take refuge inside the convenience store and the man struggled to get away.  All three assailants then descended upon the male victim and began attacking him in the parking lot.  He sustained abrasions on his right forearm and knees, while the woman suffered bruising to her chest.  None of the defendants knew their victims.  In today’s hearing, and during Hammett and Jackson’s proceedings, Judge Mendez considered the defendants’ backgrounds and criminal histories.  Tyler has the words “white pride” tattooed down the backs of his arms and a swastika on his left upper arm.  He has previously acknowledged being a member of the Yuba County Peckerwoods, a local white supremacist group.  Hammett, who has a tattoo of the words “white power” across his abdomen, was previously convicted for the unprovoked assault on a 72-year-old African-American man and was sentenced on March 25, 2014, to 87 months in prison.  Jackson, who has the words “white power” tattooed in block letters down his shins, was sentenced on April 29, 2014, to 70 months in prison.  Tyler entered his guilty plea on March 11, 2014. “These three defendants targeted the victims because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta for the Civil Rights Division.  “This type of attack causes harm not only to the immediate victims, but tears at the fabric of our communities and society itself.  The department will continue to vigorously prosecute such acts of racial violence.” “Racially motivated violence not only threatens the harmony of our diverse communities, it undermines the principle of equality under law, which is a foundation of our society,” said U.S. Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner for the Eastern District of California.  “For these reasons, prosecuting hate crimes will continue to be one of our highest priorities.” This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Yuba County Sheriff’s Office and the Yuba County District Attorney’s Office.  The case was prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Wagner and Trial Attorney Chiraag Bains of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.   \n",

       "      <td>In a nine-count indictment unsealed today, two Mississippi correctional officers were charged with beating an inmate and a third was charged with helping to cover it up.  The indictment charged Lawardrick Marsher, 28, and Robert Sturdivant, 47, officers at Mississippi State Penitentiary, in Parchman, Mississippi, with a beating that included kicking, punching and throwing the victim to the ground.  Marsher and Sturdivant were charged with violating the right of K.H., a convicted prisoner, to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  Sturdivant was also charged with failing to intervene while Marsher was punching and beating K.H.  The indictment alleges that their actions involved the use of a dangerous weapon and resulted in bodily injury to the victim. A third officer, Deonte Pate, 23, was charged along with Marsher and Sturdivant for conspiring to cover up the beating.  The indictment alleges that all three officers submitted false reports and that all three lied to the FBI. If convicted, Marsher and Sturdivant face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison on the excessive force charges.  Each of the three officers faces up to five years in prison on the conspiracy and false statement charges, and up to 20 years in prison on the false report charges. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty. This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Jackson Division, with the cooperation of the Mississippi Department of Corrections.  It is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Coleman of the Northern District of Mississippi and Trial Attorney Dana Mulhauser of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.     Marsher Indictment</td>\n",

       "632  In a nine-count indictment unsealed today, two Mississippi correctional officers were charged with beating an inmate and a third was charged with helping to cover it up.  The indictment charged Lawardrick Marsher, 28, and Robert Sturdivant, 47, officers at Mississippi State Penitentiary, in Parchman, Mississippi, with a beating that included kicking, punching and throwing the victim to the ground.  Marsher and Sturdivant were charged with violating the right of K.H., a convicted prisoner, to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  Sturdivant was also charged with failing to intervene while Marsher was punching and beating K.H.  The indictment alleges that their actions involved the use of a dangerous weapon and resulted in bodily injury to the victim. A third officer, Deonte Pate, 23, was charged along with Marsher and Sturdivant for conspiring to cover up the beating.  The indictment alleges that all three officers submitted false reports and that all three lied to the FBI. If convicted, Marsher and Sturdivant face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison on the excessive force charges.  Each of the three officers faces up to five years in prison on the conspiracy and false statement charges, and up to 20 years in prison on the false report charges. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

       "      <td>The Justice Department has reached a comprehensive settlement agreement with the city of Miami and the Miami Police Department (MPD) resolving the Justice Department’s investigation of officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer of the Southern District of Florida. The settlement, which was approved by Miami’s city commission today and will go into effect when the agreement is signed by all parties, resolves claims stemming from the Justice Department’s investigation into officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, which was conducted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  The investigation’s findings, issued in July 2013, identified a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.  The city’s compliance with the settlement will be monitored by an independent reviewer, former Tampa, Florida, Police Chief Jane Castor.  Under the settlement agreement, the city will implement comprehensive reforms to ensure constitutional policing and support public trust.  The settlement agreement is designed to minimize officer-involved shootings and to more effectively and quickly investigate officer-involved shootings that do occur, through measures that include: “This settlement represents a renewed commitment by the city of Miami and Chief Rodolfo Llanes to provide constitutional policing for Miami residents and to protect public safety through sustainable reform,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gupta.  “The agreement will help to strengthen the relationship between the MPD and the communities they serve by improving accountability for officers who fire their weapons unlawfully, and provides for community participation in the enforcement of this agreement.”  “Today's agreement is the result of a joint effort between the Department of Justice and the City of Miami to ensure that the Miami Police Department continues its efforts to make our community safe while protecting the sacred Constitutional rights of all of our citizens,” said U.S. Attorney Ferrer.  “Through oversight and communication, the agreement seeks to make permanent the positive changes that former Chief Orosa and Chief Llanes have made, and we applaud the City Commission’s vote.” The settlement agreement builds upon important reforms implemented by the city since the Justice Department issued its findings, including:  The investigation was conducted by attorneys and staff from the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the Civil Division of the U. S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Florida.</td>\n",

       "313  The Justice Department has reached a comprehensive settlement agreement with the city of Miami and the Miami Police Department (MPD) resolving the Justice Department’s investigation of officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Wifredo A. Ferrer of the Southern District of Florida. The settlement, which was approved by Miami’s city commission today and will go into effect when the agreement is signed by all parties, resolves claims stemming from the Justice Department’s investigation into officer-involved shootings by MPD officers, which was conducted under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  The investigation’s findings, issued in July 2013, identified a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution.  The city’s compliance with the settlement will be monitored by an independent reviewer, former Tampa, Florida, Police Chief Jane Castor.  Under the settlement agreement, the city will implement comprehensive reforms to ensure constitutional policing and support public trust.  The settlement agreement is designed to minimize officer-involved shootings and to more effectively and quickly investigate officer-involved shootings that do occur, through measures that include: “This settlement represents a renewed commitment by the city of Miami and Chief Rodolfo Llanes to provide constitutional policing for Miami residents and to protect public safety through sustainable reform,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gupta.  “The agreement will help to strengthen the relationship between the MPD and the communities they serve by improving accountability for officers who fire their weapons unlawfully, and provides for community participation in the enforcement of this agreement.”  “Today's agreement is the result of a joint effort between the Department of Justice and the City of Miami to ensure that the Miami Police Department continues its efforts to make our community safe while protecting the sacred Constitutional rights of all of our citizens,” said U.S. Attorney Ferrer.  “Through oversight and communication, the agreement seeks to make permanent the positive changes that former Chief Orosa and Chief Llanes have made, and we applaud the City Commission’s vote.” The settlement agreement builds upon important reforms implemented by the city since the Justice Department issued its findings, including:  The investigation was conducted by attorneys and staff from the Civil Rights Division’s Special Litigation Section and the Civil Division of the U. S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of Florida.   \n",

       "      <td>A former supervisory correctional officer at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, Louisiana, pleaded guilty yesterday in connection with the beating of a handcuffed and shackled inmate, in addition to conspiring to cover up their misconduct by falsifying official records and lying to internal investigators about what happened.     James Savoy, 39, of Marksville, Louisiana, admitted during his plea hearing that he witnessed other officers using excessive force against the inmate and failed to intervene; that he conspired with other officers to cover up the beating by engaging in a variety of obstructive acts; and that he personally falsified official prison records to cover up the attack.   Scotty Kennedy, 48, of Beebe, Arkansas, and John Sanders, 30, of Marksville, Louisiana previously pleaded guilty in November 2016, and September 2017, for their roles in the beating and cover up.   “Every citizen has the right to due process and protection from unreasonable force, and correctional officers who violate these basic Constitutional rights must be held accountable for their egregious actions” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division.  “The Justice Department will continue to vigorously prosecute correctional officers who violate the public’s trust by committing crimes and to covering up violations of federal criminal law.”   “Yesterday is another example of our office’s unwavering commitment to pursuing those who violate the federal criminal civil rights laws,” said Acting United States Attorney for the Middle District of Louisiana Corey Amundson. “We will continue to work closely with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and the FBI to ensure that no one is above the law.”     This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Baton Rouge Resident Agency and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Frederick A. Menner, Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana and Trial Attorney Christopher J. Perras of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.</td>\n",

Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance of the Northern District of Alabama announced.  According to evidence introduced at trial, Evans, a former U.S. Army soldier, and his then-wife, a Department of Defense employee, were residing in Germany when they were asked to take temporary custody of a five-year-old child whose parents were deployed to Iraq with the U.S. Army.  Evans sexually abused the child on multiple occasions during the 18 months that the child lived with him from May 2007 to December 2008.  Trial Attorney Austin M. Berry of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Hutzell of the Northern District of Alabama are prosecuting the case.  U.S. Army Criminal Investigations Division and the FBI’s Birmingham, Alabama, Division investigated the case. This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse, launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.</td>\n",

Clarence Edward Evers Jr., aka Bud, a technology teacher employed by the Conecuh County, Alabama, Board of Education, was arrested on Feb. 11, 2016, and was charged today with five counts of travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor, one count of attempted travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor, one count of production and attempted production of child pornography, one count of transportation of child pornography, one count of receipt of child pornography, one count of access with intent to view child pornography and one count of possession of child pornography. According to the indictment, Evers allegedly traveled to Thailand in the summers of 2010 through 2014 for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor and allegedly attempted to make a similar trip in the spring of 2015.  During the 2014 trip, Evers also allegedly photographed his victims’ abuse and then transported the images back to the United States.  In addition, Evers allegedly had other images of child sexual exploitation on his computers and other electronic devices. The charges contained in the indictment are only allegations.  Evers is presumed innocent unless and until he is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. ICE-HSI is investigating this case.  Trial Attorney James E. Burke IV of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sean P.

Gregory Jerome Lee, 53, formerly of Cullman County, Alabama, was indicted on four counts of production of child pornography, one count of conspiracy to advertise child pornography and one count of conspiracy to distribute and receive child pornography. According to the indictment, from September 1996 through December 2004, Lee used, persuaded, coerced and enticed minors to engage in sexually explicit conduct in order to produce images of that conduct.  Between September 1996 and August 2007, Lee conspired with other individuals to distribute and receive child pornography through a variety of means, including the Internet. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) is investigating the case.  Trial Attorney Amy E. Larson of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Hutzell of the Northern District of Alabama are prosecuting the case.  The charges and allegations contained in an indictment are merely accusations.  The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.  Members of the public who may have information related to this matter should call the USPIS Birmingham Office at (205) 326-2909. This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.</td>\n",

Mark of the Northern District of Alabama and Trial Attorney David Reese of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.

       "      <td>WASHINGTON - Daryl Lee Fierce, 69, of Charleston, W.Va., pleaded guilty today to a civil rights charge in federal court in the Southern District of West Virginia for using fire to intimidate and interfere with a person’s housing rights. Fierce set fire to the victim’s home because African-American and biracial individuals visited the victim in her home. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Fierce faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is scheduled for July 30, 2009. According to documents filed in court, on or about July 16, 2007, Fierce admitted that he set fire to a home located on Noyes Avenue in Charleston because the tenant occupying the home, a white woman, associated with persons of another race and color. Fierce set fire to the outside wall of the victim’s bedroom at night as she slept. Fierce further admitted that before the incident he had used racial epithets against guests, including young children, who visited the victim’s home. \"Living in one’s home and associating with friends of one’s choosing, without violent interference because of race, is a core right of all persons in this country,\" said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \"The defendant used violence against an innocent victim because of his racial prejudice. This is illegal, and despicable, and we will prosecute such crimes whenever and wherever they occur.\" The FBI, the Charleston Police Department and the Charleston Fire Department investigated this case. The case was prosecuted by James Walsh with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and Lisa G. Johnson, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Justice Department today announced that on March 21, 2018, a federal district court in Casper, Wyoming, found that the Wyoming Military Department (WMD) discriminated against former employee Amanda Dykes by subjecting her to sexual harassment and constructively discharging her.  The verdict was returned after a July 2017 bench trial during which the Justice Department produced evidence that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, and religion.   The evidence produced at trial showed that Dykes was subjected to sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, former employee Don Smith, when both worked at WMD’s Wyoming Youth Challenge Program.  Smith subjected Dykes to persistent, unwelcomed conduct including poems, songs, and emails professing his affection and love for her as well as constant visits to her office.  These intensified to such a degree that Dykes asked her subordinates to help her avoid being left alone with her supervisor.      Dykes reported the supervisor’s conduct to her employer’s human resources department as well as to his direct supervisor, but received no assistance in remedying the harassment.  The court found that harassing behavior persisted for over 18 months despite Dykes’ numerous complaints, that no reasonable employee could be expected to remain in her job under these circumstances, and that Dykes had no choice but to resign her position in September 2011 to avoid the continued harassment.    The district court ordered WMD to pay $221,030.62 to Dykes for the salary and benefits she lost as a result of her constructive discharge.    This judgment represents the first successful sexual harassment trial verdict obtained in a Title VII case since the launch of the Civil Rights Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative (SHWI), which focuses on workplace sexual harassment in the public sector.   As part of the Initiative, the Justice Department will continue to bring sex discrimination claims against state and local government employers with a renewed emphasis on sexual harassment charges.  The Department will also work to develop effective remedial measures that can be used to hold public sector employers accountable where Title VII violations have been found, including identifying changes to existing employer practices and policies that will result in safe work environments.  More information about the Civil Rights’ Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative can be found here.   “The Justice Department vigorously enforces Title VII to ensure that people can work free from sexual harassment and retaliation,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore  of the Civil Rights Division.  “The verdict sends the clear message that this Justice Department will continue to effectively combat sex-based discrimination whenever it occurs in a public sector workplace.”   Dykes originally filed her sexual harassment charge against the WMD with the Denver Field Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which investigated and determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that discrimination had occurred and referred the matters to the Department of Justice.             More information about Title VII and other federal employment laws is available at the division’s Employment Litigation Section website.  The continued enforcement of Title VII is a priority of the Civil Rights Division.  Additional information about the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is available on the division website.    EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its website.    The United States was represented in this case by Robert Galbreath, Torie Atkinson, Brian McEntire, and Patty Stasco.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Yuba City, California, Man Sentenced to 46 Months in Prison for Racially Motivated Attack on White Man and African-American Woman</td>\n",
       "      <td>Anthony Merrell Tyler, 34, of Yuba City, California, was sentenced today by U.S. District Court Judge John A. Mendez to serve 46 months in prison for violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  The crime involved a racially motivated attack by Tyler and two co-defendants, Billy Hammett, 30, and Perry Jackson, 29, on a white man and an African-American woman in Marysville, California, in 2011.  In addition to his term of incarceration, Tyler was ordered to serve three years of supervised release upon his release from prison and to pay $175 in restitution. According to documents filed with the court, around 10:45 p.m. on April 18, 2011, a white man and an African-American woman parked their car at a convenience store in Marysville.  Shortly afterward, the three defendants attacked the man and woman because of their race.  Jackson punched him twice in the head through the open passenger window.  At the same time, Hammett opened the driver-side door and kicked the woman in the chest.  Seconds later, Tyler smashed the car’s windshield with a crowbar, sending shattered glass into the passenger compartment.  As the attack continued, the woman managed to take refuge inside the convenience store and the man struggled to get away.  All three assailants then descended upon the male victim and began attacking him in the parking lot.  He sustained abrasions on his right forearm and knees, while the woman suffered bruising to her chest.  None of the defendants knew their victims.  In today’s hearing, and during Hammett and Jackson’s proceedings, Judge Mendez considered the defendants’ backgrounds and criminal histories.  Tyler has the words “white pride” tattooed down the backs of his arms and a swastika on his left upper arm.  He has previously acknowledged being a member of the Yuba County Peckerwoods, a local white supremacist group.  Hammett, who has a tattoo of the words “white power” across his abdomen, was previously convicted for the unprovoked assault on a 72-year-old African-American man and was sentenced on March 25, 2014, to 87 months in prison.  Jackson, who has the words “white power” tattooed in block letters down his shins, was sentenced on April 29, 2014, to 70 months in prison.  Tyler entered his guilty plea on March 11, 2014. “These three defendants targeted the victims because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta for the Civil Rights Division.  “This type of attack causes harm not only to the immediate victims, but tears at the fabric of our communities and society itself.  The department will continue to vigorously prosecute such acts of racial violence.” “Racially motivated violence not only threatens the harmony of our diverse communities, it undermines the principle of equality under law, which is a foundation of our society,” said U.S. Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner for the Eastern District of California.  “For these reasons, prosecuting hate crimes will continue to be one of our highest priorities.” This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Yuba County Sheriff’s Office and the Yuba County District Attorney’s Office.  The case was prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Wagner and Trial Attorney Chiraag Bains of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

Menner, Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana and Trial Attorney Christopher J. Perras of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.   \n",

Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Joyce White Vance of the Northern District of Alabama. Gregory Jerome Lee, 53, formerly of Cullman County, Alabama, was indicted on four counts of production of child pornography, one count of conspiracy to advertise child pornography and one count of conspiracy to distribute and receive child pornography. According to the indictment, from September 1996 through December 2004, Lee used, persuaded, coerced and enticed minors to engage in sexually explicit conduct in order to produce images of that conduct.  Between September 1996 and August 2007, Lee conspired with other individuals to distribute and receive child pornography through a variety of means, including the Internet. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) is investigating the case.  Trial Attorney Amy E. Larson of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Hutzell of the Northern District of Alabama are prosecuting the case.  The charges and allegations contained in an indictment are merely accusations.  The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.  Members of the public who may have information related to this matter should call the USPIS Birmingham Office at (205) 326-2909.

Fierce set fire to the victim’s home because African-American and biracial individuals visited the victim in her home. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Fierce faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is scheduled for July 30, 2009. According to documents filed in court, on or about July 16, 2007, Fierce admitted that he set fire to a home located on Noyes Avenue in Charleston because the tenant occupying the home, a white woman, associated with persons of another race and color. Fierce set fire to the outside wall of the victim’s bedroom at night as she slept. Fierce further admitted that before the incident he had used racial epithets against guests, including young children, who visited the victim’s home. \"Living in one’s home and associating with friends of one’s choosing, without violent interference because of race, is a core right of all persons in this country,\" said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \"The defendant used violence against an innocent victim because of his racial prejudice. This is illegal, and despicable, and we will prosecute such crimes whenever and wherever they occur.\" The FBI, the Charleston Police Department and the Charleston Fire Department investigated this case. The case was prosecuted by James Walsh with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and Lisa G. Johnson, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia.   \n",

Ernisse, 61, is currently incarcerated for state offenses related to child exploitation at the Red Granite Correctional Institution in Wisconsin.  A grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin indicted Ernisse on two counts of producing child pornography, two counts of producing child pornography outside of the United States, one count of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Philippines and one count of possessing child pornography. According to the indictment, on or about March 10, 2015 and then again, on or about April 7, 2015, Ernisse used a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing child pornography.  Between approximately June 17, 2014, and approximately April 11, 2015, Ernisse engaged in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Republic of the Philippines.  And on or about Dec. 18, 2015, Ernisse possessed child pornography. The charges contained in the indictment are merely allegations.  The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.                  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is investigating this case with the cooperation of the Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Police Department.  Trial Attorney William M. Grady of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Megan J. Paulson and Penelope L. Coblentz of the Eastern District of Wisconsin are prosecuting the case. This investigation is a part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to better locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.   \n",

       "715  The Justice Department today announced that on March 21, 2018, a federal district court in Casper, Wyoming, found that the Wyoming Military Department (WMD) discriminated against former employee Amanda Dykes by subjecting her to sexual harassment and constructively discharging her.  The verdict was returned after a July 2017 bench trial during which the Justice Department produced evidence that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, and religion.   The evidence produced at trial showed that Dykes was subjected to sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, former employee Don Smith, when both worked at WMD’s Wyoming Youth Challenge Program.  Smith subjected Dykes to persistent, unwelcomed conduct including poems, songs, and emails professing his affection and love for her as well as constant visits to her office.  These intensified to such a degree that Dykes asked her subordinates to help her avoid being left alone with her supervisor.      Dykes reported the supervisor’s conduct to her employer’s human resources department as well as to his direct supervisor, but received no assistance in remedying the harassment.  The court found that harassing behavior persisted for over 18 months despite Dykes’ numerous complaints, that no reasonable employee could be expected to remain in her job under these circumstances, and that Dykes had no choice but to resign her position in September 2011 to avoid the continued harassment.    The district court ordered WMD to pay $221,030.62 to Dykes for the salary and benefits she lost as a result of her constructive discharge.    This judgment represents the first successful sexual harassment trial verdict obtained in a Title VII case since the launch of the Civil Rights Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative (SHWI), which focuses on workplace sexual harassment in the public sector.   As part of the Initiative, the Justice Department will continue to bring sex discrimination claims against state and local government employers with a renewed emphasis on sexual harassment charges.  The Department will also work to develop effective remedial measures that can be used to hold public sector employers accountable where Title VII violations have been found, including identifying changes to existing employer practices and policies that will result in safe work environments.  More information about the Civil Rights’ Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative can be found here.   “The Justice Department vigorously enforces Title VII to ensure that people can work free from sexual harassment and retaliation,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore  of the Civil Rights Division.  “The verdict sends the clear message that this Justice Department will continue to effectively combat sex-based discrimination whenever it occurs in a public sector workplace.”   Dykes originally filed her sexual harassment charge against the WMD with the Denver Field Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which investigated and determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that discrimination had occurred and referred the matters to the Department of Justice.             More information about Title VII and other federal employment laws is available at the division’s Employment Litigation Section website.  The continued enforcement of Title VII is a priority of the Civil Rights Division.  Additional information about the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is available on the division website.    EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its website.    The United States was represented in this case by Robert Galbreath, Torie Atkinson, Brian McEntire, and Patty Stasco.   \n",

Mendez to serve 46 months in prison for violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  The crime involved a racially motivated attack by Tyler and two co-defendants, Billy Hammett, 30, and Perry Jackson, 29, on a white man and an African-American woman in Marysville, California, in 2011.  In addition to his term of incarceration, Tyler was ordered to serve three years of supervised release upon his release from prison and to pay $175 in restitution. According to documents filed with the court, around 10:45 p.m. on April 18, 2011, a white man and an African-American woman parked their car at a convenience store in Marysville.  Shortly afterward, the three defendants attacked the man and woman because of their race.  Jackson punched him twice in the head through the open passenger window.  At the same time, Hammett opened the driver-side door and kicked the woman in the chest.  Seconds later, Tyler smashed the car’s windshield with a crowbar, sending shattered glass into the passenger compartment.  As the attack continued, the woman managed to take refuge inside the convenience store and the man struggled to get away.  All three assailants then descended upon the male victim and began attacking him in the parking lot.  He sustained abrasions on his right forearm and knees, while the woman suffered bruising to her chest.  None of the defendants knew their victims.  In today’s hearing, and during Hammett and Jackson’s proceedings, Judge Mendez considered the defendants’ backgrounds and criminal histories.  Tyler has the words “white pride” tattooed down the backs of his arms and a swastika on his left upper arm.  He has previously acknowledged being a member of the Yuba County Peckerwoods, a local white supremacist group.  Hammett, who has a tattoo of the words “white power” across his abdomen, was previously convicted for the unprovoked assault on a 72-year-old African-American man and was sentenced on March 25, 2014, to 87 months in prison.  Jackson, who has the words “white power” tattooed in block letters down his shins, was sentenced on April 29, 2014, to 70 months in prison.  Tyler entered his guilty plea on March 11, 2014. “These three defendants targeted the victims because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta for the Civil Rights Division.  “This type of attack causes harm not only to the immediate victims, but tears at the fabric of our communities and society itself.  The department will continue to vigorously prosecute such acts of racial violence.” “Racially motivated violence not only threatens the harmony of our diverse communities, it undermines the principle of equality under law, which is a foundation of our society,” said U.S. Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner for the Eastern District of California.  “For these reasons, prosecuting hate crimes will continue to be one of our highest priorities.” This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Yuba County Sheriff’s Office and the Yuba County District Attorney’s Office.  The case was prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Wagner and Trial Attorney Chiraag Bains of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.   \n",

       "      <td>A former supervisory correctional officer at Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, Louisiana, pleaded guilty yesterday in connection with the beating of a handcuffed and shackled inmate, in addition to conspiring to cover up their misconduct by falsifying official records and lying to internal investigators about what happened.     James Savoy, 39, of Marksville, Louisiana, admitted during his plea hearing that he witnessed other officers using excessive force against the inmate and failed to intervene; that he conspired with other officers to cover up the beating by engaging in a variety of obstructive acts; and that he personally falsified official prison records to cover up the attack.   Scotty Kennedy, 48, of Beebe, Arkansas, and John Sanders, 30, of Marksville, Louisiana previously pleaded guilty in November 2016, and September 2017, for their roles in the beating and cover up.   “Every citizen has the right to due process and protection from unreasonable force, and correctional officers who violate these basic Constitutional rights must be held accountable for their egregious actions” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore of the Civil Rights Division.  “The Justice Department will continue to vigorously prosecute correctional officers who violate the public’s trust by committing crimes and to covering up violations of federal criminal law.”   “Yesterday is another example of our office’s unwavering commitment to pursuing those who violate the federal criminal civil rights laws,” said Acting United States Attorney for the Middle District of Louisiana Corey Amundson. “We will continue to work closely with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and the FBI to ensure that no one is above the law.”     This case is being investigated by the FBI’s Baton Rouge Resident Agency and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Frederick A. Menner, Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana and Trial Attorney Christopher J. Perras of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.</td>\n",

Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance of the Northern District of Alabama announced.  According to evidence introduced at trial, Evans, a former U.S. Army soldier, and his then-wife, a Department of Defense employee, were residing in Germany when they were asked to take temporary custody of a five-year-old child whose parents were deployed to Iraq with the U.S. Army.  Evans sexually abused the child on multiple occasions during the 18 months that the child lived with him from May 2007 to December 2008.  Trial Attorney Austin M. Berry of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Hutzell of the Northern District of Alabama are prosecuting the case.  U.S. Army Criminal Investigations Division and the FBI’s Birmingham, Alabama, Division investigated the case. This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse, launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.</td>\n",

Clarence Edward Evers Jr., aka Bud, a technology teacher employed by the Conecuh County, Alabama, Board of Education, was arrested on Feb. 11, 2016, and was charged today with five counts of travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor, one count of attempted travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor, one count of production and attempted production of child pornography, one count of transportation of child pornography, one count of receipt of child pornography, one count of access with intent to view child pornography and one count of possession of child pornography. According to the indictment, Evers allegedly traveled to Thailand in the summers of 2010 through 2014 for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor and allegedly attempted to make a similar trip in the spring of 2015.  During the 2014 trip, Evers also allegedly photographed his victims’ abuse and then transported the images back to the United States.  In addition, Evers allegedly had other images of child sexual exploitation on his computers and other electronic devices. The charges contained in the indictment are only allegations.  Evers is presumed innocent unless and until he is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. ICE-HSI is investigating this case.  Trial Attorney James E. Burke IV of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Sean P.

Gregory Jerome Lee, 53, formerly of Cullman County, Alabama, was indicted on four counts of production of child pornography, one count of conspiracy to advertise child pornography and one count of conspiracy to distribute and receive child pornography. According to the indictment, from September 1996 through December 2004, Lee used, persuaded, coerced and enticed minors to engage in sexually explicit conduct in order to produce images of that conduct.  Between September 1996 and August 2007, Lee conspired with other individuals to distribute and receive child pornography through a variety of means, including the Internet. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) is investigating the case.  Trial Attorney Amy E. Larson of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Hutzell of the Northern District of Alabama are prosecuting the case.  The charges and allegations contained in an indictment are merely accusations.  The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.  Members of the public who may have information related to this matter should call the USPIS Birmingham Office at (205) 326-2909.

       "      <td>Jeremy Heath Higgins was indicted for threatening an African-American man at a Quinton, Alabama, restaurant, and for threatening another person who ordered Higgins to leave the restaurant due to his behavior, Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance for the Northern District of Alabama announced today.   Higgins, 28, was charged in a three count indictment returned yesterday by a federal grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama.  The indictment charges him with one felony count and two misdemeanor counts of interference with a federally-protected activity.  The indictment alleges that on June 14, 2013, Higgins approached and threatened an African-American man at the Alabama Rose Steakhouse because the man was present at the restaurant with a white woman.  According to the indictment, another person ordered Higgins to leave the premises of the restaurant because of Higgins’ behavior toward the African-American man, after which Higgins allegedly shouted a threat to burn down the restaurant.  The indictment further alleges that Higgins threatened the person who had ordered him to leave the restaurant by painting graffiti on the restaurant’s exterior and fence.     If convicted of the felony count of the indictment, Higgins could face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  For each of the misdemeanor charges, Higgins could face a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $200,000 fine.   This case is being investigated by the FBI and is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Robin B. Mark of the Northern District of Alabama and Trial Attorney David Reese of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. An indictment is merely an accusation, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless proven guilty.</td>\n",

       "      <td>WASHINGTON - Daryl Lee Fierce, 69, of Charleston, W.Va., pleaded guilty today to a civil rights charge in federal court in the Southern District of West Virginia for using fire to intimidate and interfere with a person’s housing rights. Fierce set fire to the victim’s home because African-American and biracial individuals visited the victim in her home. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Fierce faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is scheduled for July 30, 2009. According to documents filed in court, on or about July 16, 2007, Fierce admitted that he set fire to a home located on Noyes Avenue in Charleston because the tenant occupying the home, a white woman, associated with persons of another race and color. Fierce set fire to the outside wall of the victim’s bedroom at night as she slept. Fierce further admitted that before the incident he had used racial epithets against guests, including young children, who visited the victim’s home. \"Living in one’s home and associating with friends of one’s choosing, without violent interference because of race, is a core right of all persons in this country,\" said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \"The defendant used violence against an innocent victim because of his racial prejudice. This is illegal, and despicable, and we will prosecute such crimes whenever and wherever they occur.\" The FBI, the Charleston Police Department and the Charleston Fire Department investigated this case. The case was prosecuted by James Walsh with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and Lisa G. Johnson, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia.</td>\n",

Cronan of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Matthew D. Krueger of the Eastern District of Wisconsin. Jeffrey H. Ernisse, 61, is currently incarcerated for state offenses related to child exploitation at the Red Granite Correctional Institution in Wisconsin.  A grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin indicted Ernisse on two counts of producing child pornography, two counts of producing child pornography outside of the United States, one count of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Philippines and one count of possessing child pornography. According to the indictment, on or about March 10, 2015 and then again, on or about April 7, 2015, Ernisse used a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing child pornography.  Between approximately June 17, 2014, and approximately April 11, 2015, Ernisse engaged in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Republic of the Philippines.  And on or about Dec. 18, 2015, Ernisse possessed child pornography. The charges contained in the indictment are merely allegations.  The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.                  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is investigating this case with the cooperation of the Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Police Department.  Trial Attorney William M. Grady of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Megan J. Paulson and Penelope L. Coblentz of the Eastern District of Wisconsin are prosecuting the case. This investigation is a part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to better locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Wyoming Military Department Found Liable for Subjecting Employee to Sexual Harassment</td>\n",
       "      <td>The Justice Department today announced that on March 21, 2018, a federal district court in Casper, Wyoming, found that the Wyoming Military Department (WMD) discriminated against former employee Amanda Dykes by subjecting her to sexual harassment and constructively discharging her.  The verdict was returned after a July 2017 bench trial during which the Justice Department produced evidence that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, and religion.   The evidence produced at trial showed that Dykes was subjected to sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, former employee Don Smith, when both worked at WMD’s Wyoming Youth Challenge Program.  Smith subjected Dykes to persistent, unwelcomed conduct including poems, songs, and emails professing his affection and love for her as well as constant visits to her office.  These intensified to such a degree that Dykes asked her subordinates to help her avoid being left alone with her supervisor.      Dykes reported the supervisor’s conduct to her employer’s human resources department as well as to his direct supervisor, but received no assistance in remedying the harassment.  The court found that harassing behavior persisted for over 18 months despite Dykes’ numerous complaints, that no reasonable employee could be expected to remain in her job under these circumstances, and that Dykes had no choice but to resign her position in September 2011 to avoid the continued harassment.    The district court ordered WMD to pay $221,030.62 to Dykes for the salary and benefits she lost as a result of her constructive discharge.    This judgment represents the first successful sexual harassment trial verdict obtained in a Title VII case since the launch of the Civil Rights Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative (SHWI), which focuses on workplace sexual harassment in the public sector.   As part of the Initiative, the Justice Department will continue to bring sex discrimination claims against state and local government employers with a renewed emphasis on sexual harassment charges.  The Department will also work to develop effective remedial measures that can be used to hold public sector employers accountable where Title VII violations have been found, including identifying changes to existing employer practices and policies that will result in safe work environments.  More information about the Civil Rights’ Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative can be found here.   “The Justice Department vigorously enforces Title VII to ensure that people can work free from sexual harassment and retaliation,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore  of the Civil Rights Division.  “The verdict sends the clear message that this Justice Department will continue to effectively combat sex-based discrimination whenever it occurs in a public sector workplace.”   Dykes originally filed her sexual harassment charge against the WMD with the Denver Field Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which investigated and determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that discrimination had occurred and referred the matters to the Department of Justice.             More information about Title VII and other federal employment laws is available at the division’s Employment Litigation Section website.  The continued enforcement of Title VII is a priority of the Civil Rights Division.  Additional information about the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is available on the division website.    EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its website.    The United States was represented in this case by Robert Galbreath, Torie Atkinson, Brian McEntire, and Patty Stasco.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Anthony Merrell Tyler, 34, of Yuba City, California, was sentenced today by U.S. District Court Judge John A. Mendez to serve 46 months in prison for violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  The crime involved a racially motivated attack by Tyler and two co-defendants, Billy Hammett, 30, and Perry Jackson, 29, on a white man and an African-American woman in Marysville, California, in 2011.  In addition to his term of incarceration, Tyler was ordered to serve three years of supervised release upon his release from prison and to pay $175 in restitution. According to documents filed with the court, around 10:45 p.m. on April 18, 2011, a white man and an African-American woman parked their car at a convenience store in Marysville.  Shortly afterward, the three defendants attacked the man and woman because of their race.  Jackson punched him twice in the head through the open passenger window.  At the same time, Hammett opened the driver-side door and kicked the woman in the chest.  Seconds later, Tyler smashed the car’s windshield with a crowbar, sending shattered glass into the passenger compartment.  As the attack continued, the woman managed to take refuge inside the convenience store and the man struggled to get away.  All three assailants then descended upon the male victim and began attacking him in the parking lot.  He sustained abrasions on his right forearm and knees, while the woman suffered bruising to her chest.  None of the defendants knew their victims.  In today’s hearing, and during Hammett and Jackson’s proceedings, Judge Mendez considered the defendants’ backgrounds and criminal histories.  Tyler has the words “white pride” tattooed down the backs of his arms and a swastika on his left upper arm.  He has previously acknowledged being a member of the Yuba County Peckerwoods, a local white supremacist group.  Hammett, who has a tattoo of the words “white power” across his abdomen, was previously convicted for the unprovoked assault on a 72-year-old African-American man and was sentenced on March 25, 2014, to 87 months in prison.  Jackson, who has the words “white power” tattooed in block letters down his shins, was sentenced on April 29, 2014, to 70 months in prison.  Tyler entered his guilty plea on March 11, 2014. “These three defendants targeted the victims because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta for the Civil Rights Division.  “This type of attack causes harm not only to the immediate victims, but tears at the fabric of our communities and society itself.  The department will continue to vigorously prosecute such acts of racial violence.” “Racially motivated violence not only threatens the harmony of our diverse communities, it undermines the principle of equality under law, which is a foundation of our society,” said U.S. Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner for the Eastern District of California.  “For these reasons, prosecuting hate crimes will continue to be one of our highest priorities.” This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Yuba County Sheriff’s Office and the Yuba County District Attorney’s Office.  The case was prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Wagner and Trial Attorney Chiraag Bains of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.</td>\n",

Menner, Jr. of the Middle District of Louisiana and Trial Attorney Christopher J. Perras of the Civil Rights Division’s Criminal Section.   \n",

Caldwell of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and U.S. Joyce White Vance of the Northern District of Alabama. Gregory Jerome Lee, 53, formerly of Cullman County, Alabama, was indicted on four counts of production of child pornography, one count of conspiracy to advertise child pornography and one count of conspiracy to distribute and receive child pornography. According to the indictment, from September 1996 through December 2004, Lee used, persuaded, coerced and enticed minors to engage in sexually explicit conduct in order to produce images of that conduct.  Between September 1996 and August 2007, Lee conspired with other individuals to distribute and receive child pornography through a variety of means, including the Internet. The U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) is investigating the case.  Trial Attorney Amy E. Larson of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Hutzell of the Northern District of Alabama are prosecuting the case.  The charges and allegations contained in an indictment are merely accusations.  The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.  Members of the public who may have information related to this matter should call the USPIS Birmingham Office at (205) 326-2909.

Fierce set fire to the victim’s home because African-American and biracial individuals visited the victim in her home. Pursuant to the plea agreement, Fierce faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. Sentencing is scheduled for July 30, 2009. According to documents filed in court, on or about July 16, 2007, Fierce admitted that he set fire to a home located on Noyes Avenue in Charleston because the tenant occupying the home, a white woman, associated with persons of another race and color. Fierce set fire to the outside wall of the victim’s bedroom at night as she slept. Fierce further admitted that before the incident he had used racial epithets against guests, including young children, who visited the victim’s home. \"Living in one’s home and associating with friends of one’s choosing, without violent interference because of race, is a core right of all persons in this country,\" said Loretta King, Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. \"The defendant used violence against an innocent victim because of his racial prejudice. This is illegal, and despicable, and we will prosecute such crimes whenever and wherever they occur.\" The FBI, the Charleston Police Department and the Charleston Fire Department investigated this case. The case was prosecuted by James Walsh with the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and Lisa G. Johnson, Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia.   \n",

Ernisse, 61, is currently incarcerated for state offenses related to child exploitation at the Red Granite Correctional Institution in Wisconsin.  A grand jury in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin indicted Ernisse on two counts of producing child pornography, two counts of producing child pornography outside of the United States, one count of engaging in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Philippines and one count of possessing child pornography. According to the indictment, on or about March 10, 2015 and then again, on or about April 7, 2015, Ernisse used a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing child pornography.  Between approximately June 17, 2014, and approximately April 11, 2015, Ernisse engaged in illicit sexual conduct with a minor in the Republic of the Philippines.  And on or about Dec. 18, 2015, Ernisse possessed child pornography. The charges contained in the indictment are merely allegations.  The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.                  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) is investigating this case with the cooperation of the Sheboygan, Wisconsin, Police Department.  Trial Attorney William M. Grady of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorneys Megan J. Paulson and Penelope L. Coblentz of the Eastern District of Wisconsin are prosecuting the case. This investigation is a part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.  Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to better locate, apprehend, and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.  For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit www.justice.gov/psc.   \n",

       "715  The Justice Department today announced that on March 21, 2018, a federal district court in Casper, Wyoming, found that the Wyoming Military Department (WMD) discriminated against former employee Amanda Dykes by subjecting her to sexual harassment and constructively discharging her.  The verdict was returned after a July 2017 bench trial during which the Justice Department produced evidence that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, and religion.   The evidence produced at trial showed that Dykes was subjected to sexual harassment by her direct supervisor, former employee Don Smith, when both worked at WMD’s Wyoming Youth Challenge Program.  Smith subjected Dykes to persistent, unwelcomed conduct including poems, songs, and emails professing his affection and love for her as well as constant visits to her office.  These intensified to such a degree that Dykes asked her subordinates to help her avoid being left alone with her supervisor.      Dykes reported the supervisor’s conduct to her employer’s human resources department as well as to his direct supervisor, but received no assistance in remedying the harassment.  The court found that harassing behavior persisted for over 18 months despite Dykes’ numerous complaints, that no reasonable employee could be expected to remain in her job under these circumstances, and that Dykes had no choice but to resign her position in September 2011 to avoid the continued harassment.    The district court ordered WMD to pay $221,030.62 to Dykes for the salary and benefits she lost as a result of her constructive discharge.    This judgment represents the first successful sexual harassment trial verdict obtained in a Title VII case since the launch of the Civil Rights Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative (SHWI), which focuses on workplace sexual harassment in the public sector.   As part of the Initiative, the Justice Department will continue to bring sex discrimination claims against state and local government employers with a renewed emphasis on sexual harassment charges.  The Department will also work to develop effective remedial measures that can be used to hold public sector employers accountable where Title VII violations have been found, including identifying changes to existing employer practices and policies that will result in safe work environments.  More information about the Civil Rights’ Division’s Sexual Harassment in the Workplace Initiative can be found here.   “The Justice Department vigorously enforces Title VII to ensure that people can work free from sexual harassment and retaliation,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General John Gore  of the Civil Rights Division.  “The verdict sends the clear message that this Justice Department will continue to effectively combat sex-based discrimination whenever it occurs in a public sector workplace.”   Dykes originally filed her sexual harassment charge against the WMD with the Denver Field Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which investigated and determined that there was reasonable cause to believe that discrimination had occurred and referred the matters to the Department of Justice.             More information about Title VII and other federal employment laws is available at the division’s Employment Litigation Section website.  The continued enforcement of Title VII is a priority of the Civil Rights Division.  Additional information about the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice is available on the division website.    EEOC enforces federal laws prohibiting employment discrimination. Further information about EEOC is available on its website.    The United States was represented in this case by Robert Galbreath, Torie Atkinson, Brian McEntire, and Patty Stasco.   \n",

Mendez to serve 46 months in prison for violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.  The crime involved a racially motivated attack by Tyler and two co-defendants, Billy Hammett, 30, and Perry Jackson, 29, on a white man and an African-American woman in Marysville, California, in 2011.  In addition to his term of incarceration, Tyler was ordered to serve three years of supervised release upon his release from prison and to pay $175 in restitution. According to documents filed with the court, around 10:45 p.m. on April 18, 2011, a white man and an African-American woman parked their car at a convenience store in Marysville.  Shortly afterward, the three defendants attacked the man and woman because of their race.  Jackson punched him twice in the head through the open passenger window.  At the same time, Hammett opened the driver-side door and kicked the woman in the chest.  Seconds later, Tyler smashed the car’s windshield with a crowbar, sending shattered glass into the passenger compartment.  As the attack continued, the woman managed to take refuge inside the convenience store and the man struggled to get away.  All three assailants then descended upon the male victim and began attacking him in the parking lot.  He sustained abrasions on his right forearm and knees, while the woman suffered bruising to her chest.  None of the defendants knew their victims.  In today’s hearing, and during Hammett and Jackson’s proceedings, Judge Mendez considered the defendants’ backgrounds and criminal histories.  Tyler has the words “white pride” tattooed down the backs of his arms and a swastika on his left upper arm.  He has previously acknowledged being a member of the Yuba County Peckerwoods, a local white supremacist group.  Hammett, who has a tattoo of the words “white power” across his abdomen, was previously convicted for the unprovoked assault on a 72-year-old African-American man and was sentenced on March 25, 2014, to 87 months in prison.  Jackson, who has the words “white power” tattooed in block letters down his shins, was sentenced on April 29, 2014, to 70 months in prison.  Tyler entered his guilty plea on March 11, 2014. “These three defendants targeted the victims because of their race,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta for the Civil Rights Division.  “This type of attack causes harm not only to the immediate victims, but tears at the fabric of our communities and society itself.  The department will continue to vigorously prosecute such acts of racial violence.” “Racially motivated violence not only threatens the harmony of our diverse communities, it undermines the principle of equality under law, which is a foundation of our society,” said U.S. Attorney Benjamin B. Wagner for the Eastern District of California.  “For these reasons, prosecuting hate crimes will continue to be one of our highest priorities.” This case was investigated by the FBI, with assistance from the Yuba County Sheriff’s Office and the Yuba County District Attorney’s Office.  The case was prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Wagner and Trial Attorney Chiraag Bains of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.   \n",

Blanco of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Dana J. Boente of the Eastern District of Virginia; and Section Chief John J. Brosnan of the FBI’s Violent Crimes Against Children Section (VCACS) made the announcement. \\xa0 Allan Cortez, 34, was charged on April 4, 2016, and pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III of the Eastern District of Virginia on April 14. \\xa0 According to admissions made in connection with the plea agreement, members of the conspiracy created false profiles on social networking sites popular with children, posing as young teenagers to lure children to two websites they controlled. Once on the conspirators’ websites, Cortez admitted that members of the conspiracy showed the children pre-recorded videos of prior minor victims, often engaging in sexually explicit conduct, to make the new victims think that they were chatting with another minor. Cortez further admitted that conspirators used these videos to coerce and entice children to engage in sexually explicit activity on their own web cameras, which could be viewed live by other members without the victim’s knowledge and which the website automatically recorded and made available for download later. Cortez admitted that he chatted with minors in furtherance of the conspiracy. The defendant also admitted that one of the websites ranked the efforts of the members to successfully coerce and entice children to engage in sexually explicit conduct on live web camera. Both websites have been disabled. \\xa0 This case was investigated as part of Operation Subterfuge, a multinational investigation coordinated by members of the FBI’s Violent Crimes Against Children (VCAC) International Task Force. VCAC special agents led the investigation with the assistance of the FBI’s Operation Rescue Me and the FBI’s Digital Analysis and Research Center and the Office of Victim Assistance. The South Africa Police Service, Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offenses, Gauteng; Royal Canadian Mounted Police, National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre; the Dutch Police Service Agency, KLPD; and the Australian Federal Police, Child Protection Operations, Sydney were active partners in Operation Subterfuge. To date, over 320 minor victims have been identified as part of this operation. \\xa0 In addition to his prison sentence, the defendant was ordered to pay $15,215 of restitution. \\xa0 Trial Attorney Lauren Britsch of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Whitney Russell of the Eastern District of Virginia prosecuted the case. \\xa0 This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice. Led by U.S. Attorneys’ Offices and CEOS, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.

       "'A Church Hill, Maryland, resident was sentenced today to 20 years in prison to be followed by a lifetime term of supervised release for enticement of a minor to engage in sexual activity and attempting to transfer obscene materials to a minor, announced Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Benjamin G. Greenberg of the Southern District of Florida.  \\xa0 Lee Robert Moore, 38, pleaded guilty March 1, 2017, before U.S. District Judge Daniel T. K. Hurley of the Southern District of Florida. Moore was employed by the U.S. Secret Service-Uniformed Division and was assigned to the White House at the time of his arrest on Nov. 9, 2015, and has remained in custody since that time. Moore has since been terminated from his Secret Service position. \\xa0 According to admissions made in connection with his plea, Moore maintained a profile on the social media application “Meet24,” which provides a mobile-based platform for exchanging digital images, as well as voice and text messages. Delaware State Police Detectives with the Delaware Child Predator Task Force created a profile on this site, posing as a 14-year-old girl, with whom Moore engaged in a number of online chat sessions, via the “Meet24” and “Kik” mobile apps over a two-month period, including while Moore was at work. A number of the online chats between Moore and the undercover officers posing as a female minor were sexual in nature and, on several occasions, Moore sent pictures of himself, including one sexually explicit image.  \\xa0 According to the plea documents, after his arrest, law enforcement discovered that Moore had communicated with a minor in Florida. Moore admitted that in those communications, he sent sexually explicit images of himself and enticed the minor to send sexually explicit photos of herself as well. Moore engaged in the same type of behavior with a 14-year-old girl in Texas and another 17-year-old girl in Missouri. Moore requested that his federal charges in Delaware be transferred to the Southern District of Florida so that he could plead guilty to both charges at one time. \\xa0 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations and the Delaware Child Predator Task Force investigated the case. Trial Attorney Austin M. Berry of the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS) and Assistant U.S. Attorney Corey Steinberg of the Southern District of Florida prosecuted the case, with assistance from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Delaware.  \\xa0 This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse, launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.
